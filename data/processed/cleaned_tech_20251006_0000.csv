Python,I built an AI with an AI - and it actually works. Here's how it went!,"Tldr: I used Zo(https://www.zo.computer/) (using 4.5 sonnet as the LLM backend) to build an implementation of the LIDA(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIDA_(cognitive_architecture)) cognitive architecture as an end-to-end stress test, and it was the first LLM tool I've seen deliver a complete and working implementation. Here's the repo to prove(https://github.com/mindpixel20/lida) it! Long version: A few days ago, I came across zo.computer(http://zo.computer/) and wanted to give it a try - what stood out to me was that it comes with a full-fledged linux VPS you've got total control over, in addition to workflows similar to Claude Pro. Naturally I wanted to use 4.5 Sonnet since it's always been my go-to for heavy coding work (there's a working FLOW-MATIC interpreter on my github I built with Claude btw). I like to run big coding projects to judge the quality of the tool and quickly find its limitations. Claude on its own, for instance, wasn't able to build up Ikon Flux(http://cadia.ru.is/wiki/_media/public:publications:ikonfluxrutrcs07006.pdf) (another cognitive architecture) - it kept getting stuck in abstract concepts like saliences/pregnance in IF context. I figured LIDA would've been a reasonable but still large codebase to tackle with Zo + 4.5 sonnet. The workflow itself was pretty interesting. After I got set up, I told Zo to research what LIDA was. Web search and browse tools were already built in, so it had no trouble getting up to speed. What I think worked best was prompting it to list out step by step what it'll need to do, and make a file with its ""big picture"" plan. After we got the plan down, I told it ""Okay, start at step 1, begin full implementation"" and off it went. It used the VM heavily to get a python environment up and running, organize the codebase's structure, and it even wrote out tests to verify each step was completed and functions as it should. Sometimes it'd struggle on code that didn't have an immediate fix but telling it to consider alternatives usually got it back on track. It'd also stop and have me run the development stage's code on the VM to see for myself that it was working, which was neat! So, for the next four or five-ish hours, this was the development loop. It felt much more collaborative than the other tools I've used so far, and honestly due to built-in file management AND a VM both me and Zo/Claude could use, it felt MUCH more productive. Less human error, more context for the LLM to work with, etc. Believe it or not, all of this was accomplished from a single Zo chat too. I honestly think Zo's capabilities set it apart from competitors - but that's just me. I'd love to hear your opinions about it, since it's still pretty new. But the fact I built an AI with an AI is freakin' huge either way!!",AIToolTesting,2025-10-05 18:30:13,Reddit

Our players are encouraged to build their bases, make friends, and strive to complete the most difficult tasks we have to offer. We can confidently boast over 500+ unique items, armors, enchantments, tools, skills, bosses, creatures and NPCs to explore and experiment with, all made in-house with an unmatched level of care and quality. The community drives our development priorities. We have a limitless well of ideas and content to release, but we will always prioritize community requests. # What we can offer: **Unique Bosses and Dungeons** - Fight bosses throughout the Realm! Use the terrain to your advantage, utilize boss weaknesses, and enjoy an exhilarating challenge as you fight through powerful foes to claim their hordes of loot! **World Border** - Explore out to a world border that expands by 1,000 blocks every Age. With an ever-expanding border, there is always fresh space to build on! **Java/Bedrock Parity** - Running on Geyser, we have done extensive testing and resource pack engineering to get all our textures and assets to be visually at one with both clients to the current capabilities of modern Minecraft. Share a cosmetic hat with your friends on both Bedrock and Java! **Territory Protection** - Protect your bases and builds from destruction with our easy to use land protection! Guard your territory, ally with other towns, and even form nations of smaller cities! **Achievement Hunting** - Complete over 400 special achievements with a varying range of difficulty from locating a rare piece of gear, to unlocking a unique chat title, or slaying a powerful boss - the more achievements you complete, the higher your fame progresses! **Leaderboards** - A fan favorite, there are leaderboards and stat trackers for all 400+ achievements in the game. Everything you achieve can be easily viewed in your achievement book! **Unique Cosmetics** - Wear a hat, a santa suit, or even a pair of colored wings!

There are many definitions out there on the internet which explain Deep Learning, but there are only a few which explain it as it is. There are few ideas on the internet, books, and courses I found: * **DL is an advanced form of Machine Learning.** * **Deep Learning is just a deeper version of Machine Learning.** * **Its a machine learning technique that uses neural networks with many layers.** * **It mimics how the human brain works using artificial neural networks.** * **Deep Learning learns directly from raw data, without the need for manual feature extraction.** And a lot is still left. But what I understood is this: Deep Learning is like teaching a computer to learn by itself from data just like we humans learn from what we see and experience. The more data it sees, the better it gets. It doesnt need us to tell it every rule it figures out the patterns on its own. So, instead of just reading the definitions, it's better to explore, build small projects, and see how it works. Thats where the real understanding begins. # What is the use of DL? DL is already being used in the things we use every day. From face recognition in our phones to YouTube video recommendations it's DL working behind the scenes. Some examples are: * Virtual assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant * Chatbots * Image and speech recognition * Medical diagnosis using MRI or X-rays * Translating languages * Self-driving cars * Stock market prediction * Music or art generation * Detecting spam emails or fake news Basically, it helps machines understand and do tasks that earlier only humans could do. # Why should we use it in daily life for automating stuff? Because it makes life easy. We do a lot of repetitive things DL can automate those. For example: * Organizing files automatically * Sorting emails * Making to-do apps smarter * Creating AI assistants that remind or help you * Making smart home systems * Analyzing big data or patterns without doing everything manually Even for fun projects, DL can be used to build games, art, or music apps. And the best part with some learning, anyone can use it now. # What is the mathematical base of DL? Yes, DL is built on some maths. Here's what it mainly uses: * Linear Algebra Vectors, matrices, tensor operations * Calculus For learning and adjusting (called backpropagation) * Probability To deal with uncertain things * Optimization To reduce errors * Statistics For understanding patterns in data But dont worry you dont need to be a math genius. You just need to understand the basic ideas and how they are used. The libraries (like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch) do the hard work for you. # Conclusion Deep Learning is something that is already shaping the future and the good part is, its not that hard to get started. You dont need a PhD or a supercomputer to try it. With a normal laptop and curiosity, you can start building things with DL and maybe create something useful for the world, or just for yourself. Its not magic. Its logic, math, and code working together to learn from data. And now, its open to all.",deeplearning,2025-10-05 18:30:13,Reddit
Keras,"Student-0YOE-EE Baltimore, MD - Looking for hardware internships with research and project experience","Hello, I am a sophomore studying electrical engineering. I am currently applying for positions in basically every concentration but I am mainly interested in hardware and embedded. I have applied to 30 internships and I have only heard back from 3 positions (all auto rejections from defense companies). My current experience is mainly in ML and computer vision from my research, but I have a few embedded projects. I don't think I want to apply for any pure SWE internships just yet since I don't think I am confident that I can pass that many technical interviews since I have not taken DSA or any of the typical CS coding classes, but I might in the future. I'm also wondering if there are any specific concentrations that I might be a good fit for given my resume.
