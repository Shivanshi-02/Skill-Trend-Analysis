But C# is Revits native language, so it gives full access to the API and way more power/flexibility.

There are many definitions out there on the internet which explain Deep Learning, but there are only a few which explain it as it is. There are few ideas on the internet, books, and courses I found: * **DL is an advanced form of Machine Learning.** * **Deep Learning is just a deeper version of Machine Learning.** * **Its a machine learning technique that uses neural networks with many layers.** * **It mimics how the human brain works using artificial neural networks.** * **Deep Learning learns directly from raw data, without the need for manual feature extraction.** And a lot is still left. But what I understood is this: Deep Learning is like teaching a computer to learn by itself from data just like we humans learn from what we see and experience. The more data it sees, the better it gets. It doesnt need us to tell it every rule it figures out the patterns on its own. So, instead of just reading the definitions, it's better to explore, build small projects, and see how it works. Thats where the real understanding begins. # What is the use of DL? DL is already being used in the things we use every day. From face recognition in our phones to YouTube video recommendations it's DL working behind the scenes. Some examples are: * Virtual assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant * Chatbots * Image and speech recognition * Medical diagnosis using MRI or X-rays * Translating languages * Self-driving cars * Stock market prediction * Music or art generation * Detecting spam emails or fake news Basically, it helps machines understand and do tasks that earlier only humans could do. # Why should we use it in daily life for automating stuff? Because it makes life easy. We do a lot of repetitive things DL can automate those. For example: * Organizing files automatically * Sorting emails * Making to-do apps smarter * Creating AI assistants that remind or help you * Making smart home systems * Analyzing big data or patterns without doing everything manually Even for fun projects, DL can be used to build games, art, or music apps. And the best part with some learning, anyone can use it now. # What is the mathematical base of DL? Yes, DL is built on some maths. Here's what it mainly uses: * Linear Algebra Vectors, matrices, tensor operations * Calculus For learning and adjusting (called backpropagation) * Probability To deal with uncertain things * Optimization To reduce errors * Statistics For understanding patterns in data But dont worry you dont need to be a math genius. You just need to understand the basic ideas and how they are used. The libraries (like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch) do the hard work for you. # Conclusion Deep Learning is something that is already shaping the future and the good part is, its not that hard to get started. You dont need a PhD or a supercomputer to try it. With a normal laptop and curiosity, you can start building things with DL and maybe create something useful for the world, or just for yourself. Its not magic. Its logic, math, and code working together to learn from data. And now, its open to all.",deeplearning,2025-10-05,Reddit,"Deep Learning https://preview.redd.it/hxix9tu81m7f1.jpg?width3200&ampformatpjpg&ampautowebp&amps6c1601a4fe1897461ffd6b1268e6a6abca628b29 # INTRODUCTION # So, What is Deep Learning?

SQL,How to ACTUALLY make your (vibe coded) apps secure (from an actual hacker),"I'm a pentester (ethical hacker) who codes SaaS part-time. I've reviewed hundreds of apps over the years, and honestly? Most have the same holes. Here's what actually keeps you safe. * **AI code review catches most issues (fr)** Look, I get it. You're shipping fast. But let Coderabbit review every pull request. It'll catch SQL injection, exposed credentials, broken auth before anything goes live. Here's a wild one: during a recent pentest, I found a race condition in a client's payment system that was double-charging customers. The dev wrote it late night with AI help. Looked totally fine to them. Would've been an absolute nightmare in production. * **Rate limiting stops the spam (and saves your wallet)** I've seen apps get absolutely hammered with 10,000+ fake registrations in minutes. Rate limiting shuts that down real quick. Without it, you're basically paying for spam. Your database fills with garbage, your email service burns through the monthly quota, and boom: One client ended up with a $500+ AWS bill from a single bot attack. Not fun lol Start strict: 100 requests/hour per IP. You can always loosen it later if real users complain, but honestly? They won't. * **Enable RLS from day 0** Row Level Security means users can only see their own data. Postgres enforces it at the database level, which is exactly where you want it. Found a dashboard during a pentest once with no RLS. I changed one URL parameter and suddenly I'm looking at everyone's data. That's literally how most data leaks happen - someone forgets this one thing. Let AI write your RLS policies if you want, but double-check them and actually try to break them yourself. * **Hide your API keys (seriously)** API keys in code will get stolen. Not maybe. Will. During pentests, I find exposed AWS keys, Stripe tokens, database passwords in repos all the time. GitHub bots are scraping for these 24/7: they'll find yours in minutes. Google Secret Manager or AWS Secrets Manager. That's it. Keys live there, not in your repo. And rotate them every 90 days. Takes like 10 minutes. * **CAPTCHA stops bots** I've tested tons of apps with and without CAPTCHA. The difference is honestly massive - we're talking 99% spam reduction. Without it? You're looking at 200+ garbage submissions daily. ""Buy our SEO services"" and crypto scams filling up your database. It's annoying as hell. Use invisible mode so real people never even see it. Bots get challenged. Slap it everywhere: contact forms, registration, login, password reset. * **HTTPS isn't optional** Every endpoint needs HTTPS. Redirect HTTP automatically. Zero exceptions here. I intercept unencrypted traffic during pentests constantly, and you'd be shocked what I see. Session tokens, passwords, API keys - all just sitting there in plain text. It's 2025, people. Let's Encrypt gives you free certificates. There's literally no excuse. * **Sanitize every input** Validate on the frontend. Validate again on the backend. Trust nothing users send you - and I mean nothing. During pentests, I'm injecting malicious code through forms, URL parameters, file uploads. Most apps fail this test. Don't be most apps. * **Update your dependencies** Old packages have known vulnerabilities. When I'm testing security, those are the first things I go after. Turn on Dependabot or Renovate. Update monthly at minimum. Security patches? Apply them the same day. This one's non-negotiable. AI makes you fast. But speed without security is just... well, it's just speed toward disaster. Here's what works: one AI writes your code. Another AI (Coderabbit) audits it. You review the audit. Three layers catching issues before they become problems. Also, rate limiting protects you when things go right too. Your app goes viral? Traffic spikes 1000x overnight? Limits keep your servers up and your costs reasonable. From pentesting hundreds of apps: these controls stop 95% of attacks. The other 5% requires skills most hackers don't have, so you're good. Seriously: I've seen apps lose 40% of users after breaches. $50,000+ incident response bills. Reputations take years to recover. These controls work. Clients stay.
