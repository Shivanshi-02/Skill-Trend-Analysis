rust,Maybe someone here can help me with my BMW M2 problem nobody can find,edit pics of brakes httpsimgur.comahKjRp7whttpsimgur.comahKjRp7w Since 8 months my 2018 BMW M2 makes some strange sound while driving. its like a squaking sound from the wheels. I could describe it like a swing for kids wiu wiu wiu wiu the sound goes faster the faster i drive so obviously it comes from the wheelsbrakes. So i went to my tuning friend and we put it on the car lift and span the wheels. and didnt make the sound i hear while driving. it makes the sound in the video. he then looked at my brakes which were okay even though its still one its first pads and discs maybe thats a reason. car has 50k km now and idrive says 40k left. keep in mind car is nearly 8 years old. so then we thought the sound comes from rust. we cleaned the inside from the disc. with the brake removed we span the wheel hub and not a single sound. He said that means it 100 must come from the brake since the wheel bearing would have made a sound. So we installed the cleaned brakes again and nothing changed. Im honest it slowly drives me crazy. the problem here is that the sound isnt always there. me and my friends tried to film this squeak sound for months now keep in mind it isnt the sound in in video. everytime they drive around me in my car slowly i hear nothing. my tunning friend heard it while doing a test drive and also said it comes from the brakes. the last thing we could do is change the discs which is pretty expensive here in germany and would be sad he said because they are more than okay. maybe someone has an idea and can help me. the only thing we thought would be the handbrake pads but idk..,BMW,2025-09-30 12:51:49,Reddit

rust,Showcase Fluid Film Rust Remover Spray Can It Really Stop Corrosion,"Using the Fluid Film AS11, I felt like I stumbled upon a secret weapon for fighting rust and corrosion. As someone who deals with maintaining everything from vehicles to metal tools regularly, finding a product that delivers as promised is like striking gold. This pack of three aerosols with a unique wool-wax formula seemed too good to pass up, especially given its promise of eco-friendliness and solvent-free composition. After weeks of testing, I think Ive uncovered both its strengths and a few areas where it could improve. Eco-Friendly Design That Packs a Punch The standout feature of this spray is its wool-wax base. Being solvent-free is a big deal for me, considering the environmental implications of many metal protectants out there. This isnt just marketed as safe for the planet but backs it up by delivering powerful rust prevention without harsh chemicals. The tack-free lubrication it provides on my gates and tools impressed me right off the bat. Whether I was spraying my cars undercarriage or tackling rust on some old garden equipment, it managed to stop corrosion on contact. Find the best price for Fluid Film AS11 on Amazon.httpsblog.sanue.compb00b93zxgs Performance in Various Applications I used this spray on a variety of surfaces, from automotive parts to some aging wooden furniture. The product claims to condition leather, vinyl, and wood as well. While I personally didnt try it on leather, it worked wonders on the wooden frames of an old cupboard. The spray soaked in just enough and left a slightly polished finish, which was a pleasant surprise. However, the standout moment for me was testing it on a couple of rusted bolts. After letting the product sit for a while, most of the rust loosened up, and I could remove the bolts without breaking a sweat. Versatility in Settings and Use This product doesnt dry out, doesnt freeze, and doesnt burn greenery when working around garden tools or trimming equipment. That last feature was particularly interesting because I accidentally sprayed nearby bushes while working and left without any damage to the plants. The spray pattern feels controlled, which helped me avoid over-application, minimizing waste. Its also worth mentioning theres no overpowering chemical smella significant plus when working in confined locations. Good Points - Long-lasting protection against rust and corrosion. - Tack-free lubrication that works well on moving parts. - Eco-friendly and solvent-free wool-wax formula. - Easy application with no harsh smell. Limitations - The size of the spray cans feels restrictive for larger-scale projects. - It leaves behind a slight residue, which could be an issue for some users. - Not a budget-friendly choice if used frequently across multiple tasks. Market Rivals Comparing the Fluid Film AS11 to the WD-40 Specialist line or PB Blaster, Fluid Film stands out for its longevity. While WD-40 excels in short-term lubrication and water displacement, it often needs reapplication sooner than I like. PB Blaster, on the other hand, feels similar in effectiveness against rusted items but lacks the eco-friendly formula that Fluid Film offers. Id recommend this product to anyone looking for more plant-friendly uses than others in this category. That said, competing sprays often come in larger quantities for similar prices, offering more value specifically for industrial upkeep. Value for Money While the Fluid Film AS11 isnt the cheapest protectant on the market, I felt its performance justified the cost for certain uses. Specifically, if youre someone who values an eco-conscious product without sacrificing quality, its worth the investment. The three-pack format is perfect for someone tackling smaller household or automotive issues, though heavy users might run out faster than anticipated. Some might feel the product is slightly overpriced compared to rivals offering bigger quantities, but for me, the long-term rust prevention offsets this concern. For the price-to-quality ratio, its quite solid if your needs match its strengths. See Fluid Film AS11 deals on Amazon now.httpsblog.sanue.compb00b93zxgs",ReviewVoyage,2025-09-30 12:51:49,Reddit
rust,Race Report Tilburg Ten Miles,"Race Information Name Tilburg Ten Miles Date September 28, 2025 Distance Ten Miles Location Tilburg Strava Grin To Win! Tilburg Ten Miles 2025 PR Run Stravahttpswww.strava.comactivities15961796812 Time 10109 httpspreview.redd.itf7ecbhmnkasf1.png?width628ampformatpngampautowebpampsf18c5a9bdd6a85e18fd5ce0315ea70efdc4794a0 Pre-race De Tilburg Ten Miles staat jaarlijkse als eerste op mijn Hardloopkalender. Dit was ooit mijn eerste evenement waar ik aan meedeed toen een collega niet meer wilde mee doen en mij het start nummer gaf. Zelfs toen ik niet echt liep, deed ik mee met de business run van het werk en bedacht ik me dan een maand van te voren dat ik die moest lopen vaak met veel lijden. Ik snapte toen dus ook niet hoe mensen zoveel sneller waren dan mij. De afgelopen 2 edities kom ik daadwerkelijk in een trainingsblok uit bij de Ten Miles voorbereiding Ten Miles en liep ik vorig jaar een PR van 10220. Dit jaar moest ik daar onder en het liefst ook nog onder het uur Op tijd ingeschreven en toch veel twijfel op de laatste dagen om hoe ik het ging aanpakken. Ook omdat ik geen rust zou pakken in de aanloop naar deze race vrijdag nog een 23 KM Workout met 8 losse kilometers op HMP en 3 KM op MP. Slim en gematigd i.v.m. de Marathon van Eindhoven, of vertrouwen op de benen en herstel vermogen en vol gas gaan. Dag van te voren heel wijs nog wel mijn kleding klaar gelegd en accesoires. Allemaal hezelfde als wat er voor de Marathon aan kleding word gekozen. Race-day, Vroeg op, goed ontbijten en op tijd omkleden alles lag een keer klaar om naar het race terrein te gaan. Daar op de foto met de groep van Greg van Hest waar ik zeer regelmatig de zondag trainingen mee loop richting de marathon en lekker bijkletsen met veel andere lopers.. Na het bijkletsen, een kleine warming up, de WC opzoeken en zorgen dat ik op tijd in het voorste startvak stap. Race Om 10.30 zou de start zijn van Wave 1, ik had mij redelijk vooraan genesteld en zou toch gaan voor een tijd rond het uur. Alles of niks, we gaan voor het PR. Start was druk, maar liep al snel rond tempo genoten wat fijn was. Ik startte fanatiek met eerst 5 KM in 1817 veel te snel en probeerde daarna toch beter op te letten op tempo. En ging naar gemiddel 345 minKM. Op 10 KM kwam ik door op 3709 een 10 KM PR, maar wist eigelijk al wel dat dat niet ideaal meer was. Na KM 12 werd het steeds zwaarder en kwam daar ook het meest verschrikkelijke stuk bij de haven voor met allemaal losse stenenklinkers. Bij 1415 KM waren de tijden wel flink opgelopen. 354 min voor die 2 KM en kon ik met moeite na het zien van het 15 KM bord een versnelling plaatsen om toch een poging te doen om op de 60 minuten uit te komen helaas er niet onder. Hier kwam een snelle kilometer uit en toen kwam ik om de hoek richting de finish het 16 KM bord tegen tesamen met een piepje van mijn horloge ik ging voor een sprint van 100 Meter naar de finish, maar dat was de finish niet maar een voetgangersbrug, de finish was nog meer dan 100 Meter verder, toch nog een beetje aangezet maar in het zicht van de finish zag ik 101 op de klok komen en ondanks mijn chip tijd en laatste sprint kwam ik uit op een tijd van 10109. Even balen, want wat als het wel maar 100 Meter was, wat als, wat als..... Maar al snel de knop omgezet en overheerst het tevreden gevoel, een PR van meer dan een minuut op een dag dat ik het zwaar had en een slechte race strategie had. httpspreview.redd.itrc1h0bw5kasf1.png?width1066ampformatpngampautowebpamps045e25a673893e36d1a72fe3ecb7adb0aa361014 Post-race Na de finish even bijkomen, bijpraten met bekende die al binnen waren of binnen kwamen en wat drinken wat wel nodig was. Daarna nog snel een foto gemaakt en door het centrum naar de Plus gegaan voor een verdiende snack en extra drinken. Waarna ik de auto instapte naar huis reed om onderweg te eten en genieten. Ondanks dat ik veel aan te merken heb omtrent bepaalde organisatorische beslissingen blijft het een mooi evenement welke ik jaarlijks probeer te lopen. Met veel mensen langs de kant, gezellige mensen en veel bekende. Ondanks dat ik het tempo niet kon vast houden en het goed zwaar had niet het gevoel gehad dat ik mij helemaal kapot liep. Achteraf superblij met het resultaat, ondanks dat ik de dag erna amper kon lopen van de spierpijn O",Hardlopen,2025-09-30 12:51:49,Reddit

rust,Deserted Carnival Calliope Echoes for Children Who Never Stopped Playing,"You can hear it before you see it. Thats the strange part. The music comes thin and cracked, drifting through dead trees like smoke. The old calliope still plays, though everyone swears the carnival shut down decades ago. I didnt believe it at first not when the stories were whispered in cafeterias, nervous kids daring one another to cross the dusty field where the Ferris wheel rusts against the skyline. I thought it was a myth. But then, one evening, I walked that way myself. I thought Id only pass by. I thought it wasnt real. The song found me first air wheezing through busted brass pipes, uneven and wrong, like someone trying to remember a tune but forgetting the order with every breath. Thats when I smelled the faint, sweet burn of candied sugar. Imagine finding the scent of melting cotton candy when the midway is nothing but weeds and wire. Thats how it hooks you. It feels familiar. Warm. Almost like safety. And then the air begins to tighten around you, and it loses that warmth. I stepped closer. I shouldnt have. The rides stand there, leaning forward, waiting. The carousel horses are frozen mid-gallop, their painted eyes peeled wide, chipped mouths open as if screaming. The games hang waiting too, prizes sagging in waterlogged rows, faded bears and rabbits with glassy eyes that look back. It feels like the moment just before lights turn on, just before the crowd comes pouring in except there is no crowd. Never again. But the carnival keeps itself alive, refusing to rot all the way through. And at the very center of it, I saw the calliope. It doesnt look like it should work. Rust crawls across its pipes, wooden panels blackened by weather and age. And yet, as I stood there, the keys pressed down one by one, invisible hands pounding out that chipped and broken song. It wasnt just sound it was an invitation. Thats when the children came. They arent alive anymore. You see it instantly. Their movements stick and jolt, like puppets with tangled strings. Their clothes are wrong too, from different decades, stiff with years of dust. But their faces God, their faces those are not young anymore. They arent childrens faces, not really. Skin stretched too thin. Eyes sunken dark with hunger. Teeth chattering, though not from cold. Have you ever seen someone smile while starving? Thats what it looks like. They came in shuffling groups, climbing down from Ferris-wheel seats, crawling out from the cracked funhouse mirrors, swinging stiff and slow from the monkey bars in the rusted playground beyond the gates. They whispered to each other in short, sharp bursts, giggling like kids playing hide and seek. But there was nothing playful in it. Their voices came out hollow, carved down by years of echoing through empty throats. One girl stepped forward. A dirty lace bow still clung to her hair. She tilted her head at me, listening, as if I had already joined their game. Tag, she rasped, and her smile spread too wide. The others followed her lead. They ran without running. Its hard to explain. One moment they were at the rides, the next they were closer, skipping forward in perfect rhythm with the blare of the calliope. Every note pulled them quicker, closer, their laughter cutting sharper, building and building and building. I tried to step back but my legs felt stiff, sluggish, the air around me folding in, weighing me down. The sound vibrated inside my chest, pressing against my ribs like it belonged inside me, not in the air at all. The closer they came, the more real they felt not like ghosts, but like children who had never stopped playing, never stopped running, never stopped feeding off the carnivals endless night. And I realized then that none of them looked older than twelve. They had been here a long, long time, but they werent allowed to grow. They were stuck between laughter and death, mouths stretching in the space between the two. Play with us, the girl whispered. Only her mouth moved this time, her words sliding into my ears without sound. Just one game. I dont entirely remember what happened next. Running, maybe. Screaming though I couldnt hear myself over the collapsing rush of music spilling from the calliope, louder and faster like organs tearing themselves apart. The rides spun. The lights snapped on for just a second, flooding the whole midway in white heat. I remember their faces in that flash children no longer, but dried husks carved into carnival masks, wide eyes and painted grins. Their fingers reached for me, thin as wires, twitching like claws, pulling at the air between us. I remember falling. And then waking. Not at home. Not in my bed. Here. The calliope is still playing now. Ive been writing this while it screams in the background, because I dont know what else to do. Ive tried leaving. Every path I take bends back to the main gates. Beyond the field, only darkness. I cant find the town anymore. Whats out there isnt roads or grass or sky its something else, some endless black canvas that doesnt end. The music doesnt stop, not for a second. Its playing outside this tent where Im hiding, its notes shaking the canvas, pressing through the ground. Every time I close my eyes I feel the children drawing closer, circling. I hear their bare feet scuffing the gravel, hear them humming along with the tune. I think I understand now. I shouldnt have come alone. Carnival games are always meant for two or more. Thats all they want. Thats why the gates keep opening every few years when someone wanders too close. Games cant exist without players. And the children they never stop. They just wait for someone new to stumble inside. The girl is standing outside my tent now. I can see her shadow against the fabric. Shes smiling. I can feel it sharp against my skin. And her voice, even softer than before, seeps through the canvas Your turn.",loudscarytruestories,2025-09-30 12:51:49,Reddit
rust,Subject 047 The Thing in the Mine True Horror Creepypasta,"I need to tell someone what happened down there. Maybe writing this out will help me make sense of it. Or maybe I just need to warn others. My name is Jake. Im a coal miner in Appalachia. Was a coal miner. I dont think I can ever go back underground again. The Beginning Another 12-hour shift. My hands were bleeding through my gloves, my back screaming with every swing of the pickaxe. But I kept going. I always keep going. My daughter Sarah has leukemia. Stage 3. Her treatment costs 340 every two weeks. Insurance doesnt cover half of it. So I dig. I bleed. I break my body in the darkness so she can live in the light. That day started like any other. Hard hat, LED headlamp, pickaxe over my shoulder. Down into the coal-black tunnels, wooden support beams creaking overhead, coal dust coating everything. Strike. Strike. Strike. The rhythm of survival. Each hit is a dollar. Each dollar is a dose of medicine. Each dose is another day for Sarah. The Discovery Then my pickaxe hit something that shouldnt exist. CLANG! Not stone. Not coal. Metal. I brushed away the debris with my gloved hands. A steel door. Heavy, industrial, buried under years of rock and coal. Warning symbols were corroded away, but I could make out edges of text ...AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY... ...BIOHAZARD... Nobody knew this was here. No records. No maps. This section of the mine was abandoned in the 1970s. I should have reported it. Should have walked away. Should have let it stay buried. But I was curious. And tired. And stupid. The door groaned as I pulled it open. My LED beam barely penetrated the darkness beyond. Cold air rushed out wrong air, stale and rotten. I stepped through. The Laboratory My headlamp revealed an underground facility that shouldnt exist. Concrete floors cracked and stained. Metal examination tables overturned, leather restraints torn apart. Broken glass vials everywhere hundreds of them, scattered like fallen stars. Medical equipment. Rusted IV stands. Surgical tools. Monitoring devices with shattered screens. And cages. Metal cages with bars bent outward from the inside. Deep claw marks scored into the walls. Restraints hanging loose, torn through. Whatever was kept here... escaped. On one wall, I found a faded document behind cracked glass PROJECT RESURRECTION Subject 047 - Status CRITICAL FAILURE Age 8 years Procedure Cellular regeneration via tissue grafting Notes Subject shows signs of consciousness but extreme aggression. Recommend immediate termination. Eight years old. They experimented on a child. The Sound Thats when I heard it. Scratching. Slow, deliberate. Coming from the far corner of the lab, beyond my lights reach. My hands gripped the pickaxe tighter. My heart hammered against my ribs. Hello? My voice cracked. Someone there? The scratching stopped. Then I heard breathing. Wet, labored, struggling. My headlamp flickered the battery dying at the worst possible moment. In the strobing light, I saw it A pale shape. Crouched. Elongated limbs folded at wrong angles. Flicker. Glowing red eyes. Flicker. Black stitching across yellowish skin. Flicker. Numbers carved into its chest 047 My headlamp steadied. And I saw Subject 047 in full. The Monster It was humanoid. Six feet tall but skeletal, emaciated. Pale yellowish skin stretched over bones. Black surgical stitching crisscrossed its entire body arms, legs, torso, face. Like someone had torn a person apart and sewn them back together wrong. Its limbs were too long. Too thin. Clearly attached surgically, different skin tones at the joints where theyd been grafted on. But the worst part? Its face. It still looked like a child. A childs features stretched and distorted. Eyes that glowed red like burning embers, but underneath... I could see they were still human eyes. Scared. Confused. In pain. It wore a tattered hospital gown cream colored, stained, with 047 printed on the chest. We stared at each other. Man and monster. Predator and prey. Father and... another victim of a cruel world. The Connection It moved closer. Not attacking crawling. Its elongated limbs moved with jerky, puppet-like motions. It reached one stitched hand toward me, and I saw its fingers trembling. It tried to speak. Its mouth opened, vocal cords damaged by whatever theyd done, and only a rasping whisper emerged ...hurts... God. It was still in there. The child was still in there, trapped in this nightmare body. I lowered my pickaxe. Im sorry, I whispered. Im so sorry for what they did to you. Its glowing red eyes flickered and for just a moment, they looked normal. Brown. A childs eyes. It saw me. Really saw me. And I saw my daughter in its suffering. The Change Then its body convulsed. It doubled over, clutching its stomach. The red glow in its eyes intensified. Hunger. It had been trapped down here for decades. Alone. Starving. Waiting. The connection wed shared vanished. The human consciousness retreated behind primal need. It looked at me differently now. Not as a person. As food. Wait I started backing away. Wait, I can help It lunged. The Chase I ran. Boots pounding coal dust, LED beam bouncing wildly off tunnel walls. Behind me, the creature pursued with unnatural speed, its elongated limbs carrying it in a horrific crawl. Left tunnel. Right. Another left. The mine was a maze. Id worked here for three years and still got lost sometimes. Now I was running blind, my headlamp dying, the creatures glowing red eyes visible in my peripheral vision. Gaining. It was gaining. I turned a corner and slammed into solid rock. Dead end. Id taken a wrong turn. I spun around just as it reached me. The End It tackled me to the ground. My headlamp flew off, clattering across the tunnel floor, casting crazy shadows. The creatures face was inches from mine, its breath cold and wrong. Those red eyes... they flickered again. Human. Monster. Human. Monster. It was fighting itself. The hunger versus what little humanity remained. I stopped struggling. My hands fell to my sides. Its okay, I whispered, and I meant it. Its okay. I thought of Sarah. My beautiful daughter. Id been killing myself slowly in these mines to keep her alive. Working myself to death for medicine money. Maybe... maybe this was just a faster way to do the same thing. This creature Subject 047 it had been a child once too. Taken. Experimented on. Tortured. Left to suffer alone in the dark for decades. If my death could end its pain, even for a moment... I understand, I told it. Im a father too. I know what its like to hurt for your child. To do anything to make their pain stop. Its red eyes dimmed. Tears actual tears streaked down its stitched face. It was grateful. And sorry. And so, so tired. My last thought before everything went dark was simple At least my suffering fed another child. Epilogue They found my hard hat three days later. My pickaxe. My wedding ring in the tunnel. They never found me. They sealed that section of the mine. Said it was structurally unsound. Dangerous. Nobody goes down there now. But sometimes, miners in nearby tunnels report strange sounds. Scratching. Breathing. Crying. And once, just once, someones headlamp caught something moving in the deep darkness. Something pale. Something stitched together. Something with glowing red eyes that looked almost... peaceful. Subject 047 isnt hungry anymore. But its still down there. Still waiting. Still alone. If youre reading this and you work underground in mines, in tunnels, in caves please. Be careful. Not everything buried should be found. And not every monster chose to become one.

AI in Healthcare,"Reform, relief and road to ballot box","MALAYSIAS Budget 2026 is not just another fiscal blueprint, it is a statement of intent at a time when the nation faces economic strain and rising public expectations. As the first budget under the 13th Malaysia Plan 13MP, it must walk a tightrope, providing relief to households, proving the governments commitment to reform and signalling fiscal discipline to investors. With speculation of a general election in the second half of 2026 or in 2027, depending on coalition stability and public sentiment, every line item in the budget carries economic and political weight.Subsidy rationalisation, symbolismOne headline policy ahead of the budget is the adjustment of the RON95 petrol subsidy, which reduced prices from RM2.05 to RM1.99 per litre for Malaysian citizens effective Sept 30. Under the Budi Madani RON95 scheme, targeted subsidies limit access to citizens while excluding corporations and most non-citizens, with exemptions for groups like e-hailing drivers. The government argues this targeted mechanism reduces leakage, especially cross-border smuggling of fuel, while freeing up between RM2.5 and RM4 billion annually for reinvestment in public transport, healthcare and assistance for lower-income groups. For citizens affected by inflation, the small but symbolic drop to RM1.99 offers relief at the pump and a reminder that subsidy reform can be politically palatable if handled carefully.Governance and reformBeyond subsidies, governance reform is expected to feature strongly in Budget 2026. Under the Ekonomi Madani framework, the government has signalled measures to strengthen transparency in procurement, restructure state-linked enterprises and accelerate the digitalisation of public services. The proposed legislations, such as a Freedom of Information Act and an Ombudsman Act, could become cornerstones of a new governance framework. If sincerely implemented, these reforms could restore trust and raise Malaysias attractiveness to investors.Competitiveness also looms large. The government has identified semiconductors, artificial intelligence AI and the digital economy as high-growth sectors. With semiconductors already contributing more than 5.1 of gross domestic product GDP, Budget 2026 is expected to include incentives to move Malaysia up the value chain, from being an assembly and testing hub to becoming a centre for design, innovation and advanced packaging. Investment in talent development, particularly in AI and automation, alongside stronger industry-academia linkages, is seen as vital. Success here will determine whether Malaysia escapes the middle-income trap or risks stagnation in an increasingly high-tech global economy.Social welfare, public sentimentSocial welfare will remain a key pillar. With food and housing costs rising, and many households still recovering from pandemic-era financial strain, cash aid and targeted subsidies are likely to be expanded. The challenge lies in balancing compassion with prudence. Subsidy rationalisation, while necessary to curb wastage, can spark discontent if poorly communicated. The government must convince voters that rationalisation is not austerity but reallocation, channelling scarce resources to where they are most needed.Fiscal consolidation and climate imperativesMalaysias fiscal deficit, which surged during the pandemic, has narrowed in recent years though public debt remains high at around 64.6 of GDP testing the countrys fiscal limits. Growth in 2025 hovers at 4.1, reflecting resilience and also exposure to risks, such as a slowing China, volatile commodity prices and ongoing geopolitical tensions. For Putrajaya, the message is clear fiscal space is limited but expectations for action are immense.Fiscal consolidation cannot be ignored. The government has pledged to reduce the deficit to below 3 of GDP by 2030, a goal requiring spending discipline and new revenue streams. Options include expanding the tax base through stronger SST compliance, raising taxes on alcohol or tobacco and exploring carbon taxation. Simultaneously, Malaysias climate vulnerability demands heavy investment in flood mitigation, renewable energy and resilient infrastructure spending that is urgent and politically difficult to postpone. The test will be whether these priorities can be delivered without overshooting fiscal limits already stretched by high debt.The ballot boxIn such a climate, Budget 2026 inevitably doubles as a political manifesto. Measures like the petrol price cut to RM1.99 can be read as both a policy and pre-election gesture, designed to show that the government is easing the rakyats burdens while pushing reforms. Whether voters view these moves as genuine relief or electioneering will depend on how credibly the government delivers broader reforms in governance, growth and equity.Still, the risks are clear. If subsidy reforms trigger discontent, if growth falters under global pressures or if governance reforms stall, Budget 2026 could quickly become a political liability. Conversely, if it strikes the right balance between relief and reform, it could be remembered as the budget that restored fiscal credibility while keeping Malaysians onside during tough times.Ultimately, Budget 2026 is about more than balancing numbers it is about charting a vision of Malaysia that is productive, equitable and resilient. It must reassure international markets that fiscal discipline remains intact while persuading citizens that sacrifices are fairly shared and future prosperity is being built today. In an environment where every sen counts and every move is politically scrutinised, this budget may decide not only the health of the economy but also the course of Malaysias next election.Dr Paul Anthony Maria Das is a senior lecturer at the School of Accounting and Finance, Faculty of Business and Law, Taylors University.

AI in Healthcare,Trumps AI conspiracy video stirs online debate,"Donald Trump has stirred online outrage after posting an AI-generated video of himself promising every American access to all-healing MedBed hospitals, reviving a widely debunked conspiracy theory.The deepfake video posted on Saturday on the US presidents Truth Social account was styled as a Fox News segment and featured his daughter-in-law Lara Trump promoting the White Houses launch of a historic new healthcare system.The phony clip then purported to show Trump announcing from the Oval Office that every American will soon receive their own MedBed card, guaranteeing access to new hospitals led by the top doctors and equipped with the most advanced technology.The only problem? Such hospitals do not exist.MedBed, tied to the QAnon conspiracy movement, is an imaginary medical device equipped with futuristic technology that adherents say can cure any ailment, from asthma to cancer.Some QAnon adherents believe that MedBed technology was used to keep late president John F Kennedy alive for years after his assassination and was purposely being denied to ordinary citizens.Trump later deleted the contentious post, without offering any explanation. There was no immediate comment from the White House.But an archived version of his post and video, which offered no disclosure that it was AI-generated, widely circulated across social media platforms.If MedBed technology were real, it would be the greatest medical advance in generations, Matthew Gertz, a senior fellow at the watchdog Media Matters, wrote on X.Trump should have to explain why he suggested it was using the channel he makes major policy announcements, and why he deleted it after the fact.Fox News told US media outlet The Verge that the phony segment never aired on Fox News Channel or any other Fox News Media platforms.How do you bring people back to a shared reality when those in power keep stringing them along? asked Noelle Cook, a researcher and author of The Conspiracists Women, Extremism, and the Lure of Belonging.Trump is no stranger to conspiracy theories and contentious health claims.Last week, the president vehemently insisted that pregnant women should tough it out and avoid the painkiller Tylenol due to an unproven link to autism and urged major changes to the standard vaccines administered to babies.The claim was dismissed by the World Health Organization, which asserted that neither Tylenol nor vaccines have been shown to cause autism.

AI in Healthcare,Does he think theyre real? Jake Tapper befuddled as Trump pushes insane conspiracy,"CNN anchor Jake Tapper poked fun at President Donald Trump after he promoted a new cure-all bed for U.S. hospitals over the weekend.Trump promoted the concept of med beds, posting an AI-generated video to his Truth Social account and claiming Americans would receive cards to gain access to advanced hospitals and doctors. The video resembled a Fox News segment and featured an AI-generated Trump promising revolutionary healthcare tech. The post was deleted within hours.Tapper joined CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale to express disbelief that the president of the United States could fall for such a video, which included his own fake voice. It seemed way too good to be true because, of course, it was not true. Not anything about it was true, Tapper told viewers on Monday afternoon.He called the med bed story terrifying conspiratorial and an insane conspiracy theory.Im happy for you that you only just learned about this. So, Med beds are an entirely fictional product that are the centerpiece of a multi-part conspiracy theory popular with QAnon types and other members of the fringe online far-right, said Dale. The far-fetched conspiracy says the beds can cure cancer, diabetes, and even grow back missing limbs. Believers say the tech has been hoarded by a secretive group of liberal billionaires, the deep state, or even the military, and that Trump would return to office and give the beds to everyone.Its fun to make jokes about it, but its easy to find doctors who are actually encountering actual people with serious medical issues in the United States who are reluctant to get treatment for them because they think theyre going to get the med bed and be fine without the medicine that will actually cure them, said Dale. By promoting this video, President Trump has done something, I think, serious in addition to something pretty weird.Tapper couldnt get over the bizarre fact that Trump appeared to be duped by such an obviously fake video.Its also just so strange. Does he not know that that was not him? Did he even watch the video before he put it out? Does he think med beds are real and hes opening up a med bed hospital? asked Tapper, as Dale chuckled. I know were like far beyond through the looking glass here, but its just super strange.",rawstory,2025-09-30 12:51:49,NewsData

AI in Healthcare,Finding the Right Product Development Firm in Karnataka A Deep Dive for Businesses,"Karnataka, with its epicenter Bengaluru, stands as the undeniable heart of Indias technological revolution. Dubbed the Silicon Valley of India, this state is a magnet for innovation, talent, and entrepreneurial spirit. For businesses, both established enterprises and ambitious startups, looking to launch a new digital product or transform an existing one, the sheer volume of product development firms in Karnataka can be both an opportunity and a challenge. How do you cut through the noise to find a partner that not only understands your vision but can also execute it with precision, scalability, and strategic foresight? This deep dive will guide you through the critical factors, due diligence, and strategic considerations for selecting the ideal product development firm in Karnataka to ensure your projects success. The Karnataka Advantage More Than Just a Name Before diving into selection criteria, its crucial to acknowledge why Karnataka is a prime location for product development Unparalleled Talent Pool Home to premier engineering institutions and a thriving tech ecosystem, Karnataka offers access to a vast pool of highly skilled software engineers, AIML specialists, UIUX designers, and product managers. Innovation Hotbed The states dynamic startup culture fosters an environment of rapid iteration, cutting-edge technology adoption, and a problem-solving mindset crucial for modern product development. Cost-Effectiveness Relative While not the cheapest, the combination of high-quality talent and competitive pricing often yields superior value compared to Western markets. Global Exposure Many firms in Karnataka have extensive experience working with international clients, understanding global best practices and diverse market needs. Beyond the Brochure 7 Critical Factors for Selection Choosing a product development firm isnt about ticking boxes its about finding a true partner. Here are the paramount factors to evaluate 1. Specialized Domain Expertise The Nuance Does the firm genuinely understand your industry e.g., FinTech, Logistics, Healthcare, Industrial IoT? A generalist might build functional software, but a specialist understands the unique regulatory challenges, user behaviors, and specific terminologies of your sector. Action Look for case studies, client testimonials, and team experience specifically within your domain. A firm that speaks your industrys language will accelerate development and minimize costly misunderstandings. 2. Product-First, Engineering-Driven Philosophy The Nuance Many firms are excellent at coding. But true product development requires a product mindset a focus on user needs, market fit, and business outcomes before writing a single line of code. They should be able to challenge your assumptions constructively. Action Inquire about their product discovery process, their approach to defining Minimum Viable Products MVPs, and how they integrate UIUX design from the outset. 3. Technical Prowess amp Technology Stack The Nuance Are they proficient in modern, scalable technologies? This includes cloud-native architectures AWS, Azure, GCP, microservices, robust backend frameworks Node.js, Python, Java, modern front-end stacks React, Angular, Vue.js, and mobile development. Action Discuss their approach to scalability, security, and maintainability. For AI-driven products, assess their expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, MLOps, and data science. A strong firm will be technology-agnostic but deeply proficient in tools that deliver robust solutions. 4. Agile Methodologies amp Transparent Communication The Nuance Modern product development thrives on agility. A firm should use iterative development Scrum, Kanban allowing for flexibility, continuous feedback, and rapid adaptation. Transparency in progress, challenges, and decisions is non-negotiable. Action Ask about their communication cadence daily stand-ups, weekly demos, project management tools, and how they handle scope changes. Look for a partner who prioritizes clear, consistent dialogue. 5. Robust Security amp Compliance Frameworks The Nuance For any digital product, especially in regulated industries like FinTech or HealthTech, security is paramount. Compliance with data protection laws GDPR, DPDPA and industry standards isnt optional. Action Inquire about their internal security protocols, data encryption practices, penetration testing, and their experience navigating regulatory landscapes relevant to your product. 6. Scalability amp Post-Launch Support The Nuance An MVP is just the beginning. The product needs to scale seamlessly as your user base grows. A good firm considers future growth from day one and offers ongoing support, maintenance, and further feature development. Action Discuss their DevOps capabilities, cloud infrastructure management, and their philosophy on long-term partnership versus a one-off project. 7. Proven Track Record amp Client Validation The Nuance Claims on a website are one thing independent validation is another. Action Request detailed case studies relevant to your needs. Critically, seek out and scrutinize reviews and testimonials on independent B2B review platforms like Clutch.cohttpClutch.co, G2, or industry-specific forums. Talk to past clients if possible. Due Diligence Checklist Your Actionable Steps Initial Research Scour firm websites, LinkedIn profiles of their key personnel, and industry reports. Portfolio Review Demand a detailed portfolio with specific examples of similar projects. Team Meet amp Greet Insist on meeting the actual development team members who would work on your project, not just sales or project managers. Assess their technical depth and cultural fit. Proposals amp Scope Definition A good proposal goes beyond a price tag it outlines methodology, timelines, deliverables, and how risks will be managed. References Always ask for client references and follow up on them. Trial Project Optional but Recommended For larger engagements, a small, paid discovery phase or a mini-project can be a low-risk way to assess compatibility and quality before committing fully.

The answer is yesespecially in certain cases. Heres why Time zone alignment amp responsiveness Localnearby consultancies are more likely to share working hours, making communication smoother. On-site presence Sometimes youll need in-person workshops, infrastructure assessments, or data center audits. A local consultant can do this more easily.

Define Your Goals amp Scope First Before reaching out, list your objectives e.g., migrate to cloud, integrate CRM ERP, improve security posture, implement BI dashboards.

How well will they communicate with your internal teams? Good chemistry helps. F. Pricing Model amp Transparency Common models Time amp materials hourlydaily rates Fixedprice for clearly scoped projects Retainer managed services Outcome-based milestone-based Make sure there are no hidden costs like travel, tools, or change orders. G. SLAs, Support amp Maintenance Ask about postdelivery support, SLA guarantees, maintenance windows, and escalation paths. H.

Legal amp Contract Terms Ensure clear statements of work, confidentiality NDAs, IP ownership, liability clauses, and exit terms.

Costs, Pricing Models amp Return on Investment Common Pricing Models Hourly Time amp Materials You pay for hours worked plus expenses. Fixed Price Milestone-Based For well-scoped projects. Retainer Managed Services Monthly fee for ongoing support. Outcome-Based Value-Based Payment linked to agreed KPIs or results. Cost Ranges For local or midsized consultancies in the U.S. Hourly rates might range from 150 to 350 per hour, depending on seniority, location, and domain. Fixed projects e.g., small cloud migration or BI implementation may run from 50,000 to 200,000 depending on scope. Monthly retainers for ongoing support could range from 5,000 to 20,000 for midsized firms. Of course, the actual cost depends on complexity, duration, number of consultants, and external dependencies. ROI Considerations Before hiring Estimate cost savings automation, reduction in downtime Improved revenue better analytics, customer experience Risk reduction less security incidents, compliance fines Time-to-market advantage faster deployments Aim for at least a 35 return over the contract lifecycle. Common Pitfalls amp How to Avoid Them Unclear scope Always define and freeze scope before starting Vendor lock-in Ask for open standards, avoid proprietary black boxes Lack of stakeholder buy-in Engage leadership, users, and IT early Ignoring change management Training and adoption are critical Security amp regulatory neglect Dont treat security as an afterthought Poor communication Use regular status reports and governance Overpromising underdelivering Be realistic in timelines amp deliverables Too much custom code with no documentation Leave maintainability behind Local vs. National Consultancies Pros amp Cons Local Regional Consultancies Pros Easier to meet face-to-face Better knowledge of local laws and networks Potentially better responsiveness Often more flexible and cost-competitive Cons Limited specialization in niche domains Smaller resource pools less bench strength Possibly less exposure to cutting-edge global practices National Global Consultancies Pros Access to top-tier talent and broader expertise Global best practices and methodologies Credibility and brand name carry weight Cons Less flexible, bureaucratic Higher cost Less attentive to localregional quirks In many cases, a hybrid a local consultancy that partners with larger firms or taps into national talent is ideal.

AI in Healthcare,I Analyzed Top Healthcare Instagram Accounts 1M Combined Followers. Heres Their Unwritten Social Media Playbook,"So Im building a Marketing AI, and I spend a lot of time analyzing what separates successful brands on social media from those who struggle to see results. A commenter on a previous post asked me to look into chiropractors, so I got curious. Okay so the title says healthcare and yeah i limited this to chiropractors but its close enough i swear haha. I pointed my analysis engine at some of the top-performing chiropractor accounts on Instagram to see if I could identify any data-backed trends or best practices specific to your niche. The results were pretty interesting and I wanted to share them online! 1. Personal branding dominates over practice-based organizational accounts. 90 of all posts across top performers in the niche feature the practitioners face, they were on camera demonstrating an exercise, explaining a concept or working with a patient What this means for you is if your social media marketing is from the perspective of your organizational brand, then you should consider rebranding into a personal brand. 2. A surprising discovery for this niche a higher promotional frequency works, but only if you do it right. One of the most interesting findings was that top accounts post promotional content far more often than the typical 2 promo 8 non-promo rule you hear everywhere. The data showed an essentially opposite mix of 8 promotional or practice-related posts for every 2 purely educationalnon-promotional posts was the best practice for this niche. However, theres a crucial catch the vast majority of these promos are soft-sells. They avoid aggressive, hard-sell phrases like Book Now! Instead, they focus on demonstrating value, showing patient results with consent, and educating the audience on the benefits of their care. This builds credibility and lets the results do the selling. 3. Engagement Questions are the best CTA for this niche For CTAs a clear winner emerged.

AI in Healthcare,The Morning Market Report,"TLDR The SPY is consolidating above key support as traders brace for a possible government shutdown. US gold reserves have soared past the 1 trillion mark, driven by record gold prices and deficit concerns. President Trumps proposal to impose a 100 tariff on all non-US produced movies creates turmoil for global entertainment markets, while Washingtons approval of Virginia-class submarine sales to Canberra further strengthens the AUKUS strategic partnership. Premarket market attention centers on Lamb Weston and Nike earnings, plus imminent Fed speakers and key FOMC reports, with sector rotation shifting towards financials and energy amid a broad downturn in defensive and cyclical indices. Analyst sentiment poll reveals the market direction for today 46 bullish, 33 bearish, and 21 neutral. For SPYhttpsflic.krp2rwgYGW technical levels, support is anchored at 661, with an immediate base between 657 and 660. Resistance looms at 664 and 665.76, with bullish breakout potential above 666. The ETF is consolidating above its displaced moving average DMA and major moving averages, reinforcing a bullish bias supported by a Money Flow Index reading above 50, a positive Directional Movement Index DI gt -DI, and a strong ADX. Momentum traders should focus on potential V-bottom or mean reversion triggers. Lamb Weston is set to report earnings, with analysts estimating an EPS of 0.53 on revenues of 1.62 billion. The market anticipates weak results due to ongoing pricing pressures, declining traffic, and rising costs, signaling a negative premarket reaction for the consumer defensive sector. Nike also reports, with projected EPS in the 0.270.28 range and revenue near 11 billiona 60 year-over-year earnings decline but potential for a sequential rebound. While easier comparables may prompt renewed optimism, guidance remains critical given ongoing tariff and consumption headwinds initial sentiment is cautiously positive for consumer discretionary stocks. Weak earnings from Lamb Weston are likely to pressure sentiment in the food and staples space, while Nikes outlook could either reignite retail risk appetite or reinforce caution depending on managements comments. Remarks from Fed Vice Chair Jefferson and Chicago Fed President Goolsbee. Their speeches may offer signals on monetary stance, impacting interest-rate-sensitive sectors and increasing volatility across financials and tech, especially if commentary is hawkish or dovish. For trading strategy, defensive asset allocation in bonds and low-beta stocks remains preferable, with the Feds tone potentially driving sharp sector moves. JOLTS job openings and consumer confidence releases. Softer labor and confidence data would amplify a risk-off mood, especially in cyclicals and rate-sensitive asset spaces. Pending the data, tactical breaks in support may prompt rotation into defensive assets, gold, and volatility trades. The threat of a US government shutdown is at the forefront, with President Trump warning about lasting federal layoffs if a funding deal is not reached. This headline risk amplifies volatility and uncertainty across the board. At the same time, US gold reserves have jumped above 1 trillion in valuationan extraordinary milestone triggered by golds rise to 3,824 per ounce. Sector ETFs like GLD, and miners NEM and GOLD, now command strong momentum as investors crowd safe havens. In the realm of defense and international relations, the United States has finalized the sale of Virginia-class submarines to Canberra, strengthening Australias military capabilities under the AUKUS pact and signaling deepening US engagement in Indo-Pacific security architecture. Meanwhile, President Trumps 100 tariff proposal on foreign-produced movies shakes the film industry, introducing new regulatory risk to entertainment equities and content companies.Trump also won a lawsuit against Google YouTube for 24 Million. Fuzzy Panda Research has released a high-profile short report targeting Rezolve Ai RZLV, alleging aggressive accounting. Rezolve Ai responded, rejecting the allegations and reaffirming its financial transparency and growth strategy, but the stock fell 11 and remains under scrutiny ahead of its next investor call. Sector leaders remain concentrated in financials and selective energy names. Sector laggards include real estate, consumer staples, healthcare, and cyclicals, reinforcing the current defensive stance among institutional investors. Within sector growth opportunities, financials hold promise through value-oriented regional and money center banks, while integrated energy majors offer attractive entry for diversified portfolios. Technology, led by select software companies and semiconductors, stands out for long-term growth, although traders should monitor for reversal setups to capture buying opportunities in oversold names. Semiconductor stocks such as NVIDIA and AMD remain favored for dip buys, while well-capitalized regional and major banks are attractive if further sector weakness emerges.

AI in Healthcare,The Pros and Cons of Artificial Intelligence ironically written by chatgpt,"Artificial Intelligence AI is no longer a distant sci-fi dream its here, shaping the way we work, learn, shop, and live. From Siri and ChatGPT to self-driving cars and predictive analytics, AI is embedded in more of our daily lives than we might realise. But like any powerful tool, AI has both upsides and downsides. Lets break down the pros and cons. --- The Pros of AI 1. Automation amp Efficiency AI can handle repetitive, time-consuming tasks faster and more accurately than humans. Think data entry, scheduling, customer service chats, or even manufacturing processes. This frees up human workers for more creative and strategic roles. 2. 247 Availability Unlike people, AI doesnt need to sleep. It can work around the clock, providing support, monitoring systems, or analysing data without breaks. 3. Data-Driven Decisions AI can analyse vast amounts of data quickly and spot patterns humans might miss. This leads to better business insights, personalised recommendations, and smarter decision-making. 4. Enhanced Personalisation From Netflix suggestions to tailored marketing, AI personalises our digital experiences. It adapts to our preferences, making services more relevant and engaging. 5. Innovation amp Discovery AI helps researchers in fields like medicine, climate science, and space exploration. It speeds up breakthroughs by crunching data and simulating outcomes things that would take humans years. --- The Cons of AI 1. Job Displacement Automation can replace human workers, especially in routine or manual roles. While it creates new jobs in tech and data fields, not everyone is ready or able to make that shift. 2. Bias and Fairness Issues AI learns from data but if that data reflects human bias, AI can repeat or even amplify it. This can lead to unfair decisions in hiring, lending, policing, and more. 3. Privacy Concerns AI-powered systems often rely on vast amounts of personal data. Without proper regulation, this can lead to surveillance, data misuse, or breaches of privacy. 4. Dependence on Technology The more we rely on AI, the more we risk losing essential skills or critical thinking abilities. Overdependence can lead to complacency. 5. Lack of Transparency Many AI systems operate as black boxes, meaning we dont fully understand how they make decisions. This lack of explainability can be risky, especially in areas like healthcare or law. --- Final Thoughts AI is a double-edged sword. It holds massive potential to improve our lives, but it also raises serious ethical, economic, and social questions. The key? Responsible development. That means building AI systems that are transparent, fair, and used to complement not replace human intelligence. Whether we thrive in the age of AI depends not just on the tech itself, but on how we choose to use it.",JamieHBrown,2025-09-30 12:51:49,Reddit

GDPval evaluated 1,320 tasks created by professionals averaging 14 years of experience across 9 economic sectors like healthcare and finance. Opus 4.1 achieved the highest scores with a 47.6 win rate and excelled at visual presentation tasks, while GPT-5 led in technical accuracy. OpenAI also found that performance tripled from GPT-4o to GPT-5 over 15 months, showing rapid improvement in workplace task capabilities. Despite the headlines of immediate workforce replacement, GDPval shows even the best models are just reaching parity with professionals on certain tasks.

THey are helpless in society. 1 in 7 children are abused in US. 1 in 5 in Europe. and 5 die everyday due to abuse in US. So its extremely common httpswww.nationalchildrensalliance.orgmedia-roomnational-statistics-on-child-abusehttpswww.nationalchildrensalliance.orgmedia-roomnational-statistics-on-child-abuse So if its this common whats to say a child is imagining things and that all of their depressive tendecies mean that a fucking toddler is sick or crazy? Are these professionals magical? Are the omnipresent? No. So many crimes could be prevented if people would pay attention, but they are targetting kids on purpose. These arent professionals they are predators trying to make children dependent on a faulty system by blaming them for their own abuse. Not to mention childrens wards, especially mental and behavioral wards have a history of physical violence and sexual abuse. Theres also an uprise of these people being caught with child porn, the real stuff not only ai generated and health professionals being caught tormenting, bullying, or outright committing acts of torture onto children. Hoarding children to possibly be sold to predators, or hiding evidence when a child goes missing. They should not be trusted. Its getting more and more common that we find people who work in childcare or healthcare are purposely in those jobs to torture others, and we need to be vigilant instead of blindly trusting to someone because of their jobs. Two Thirds of American Kids Cant Read Fluently Scientific Americanhttpswww.scientificamerican.comarticletwo-thirds-of-american-kids-cant-read-fluently Apparently a majority of todays youth are also being failed by the education system, and their own families and cannot read. Its not laziness its the way they were raised. Why werent they taught how to read? Who didnt teach them? How were they growing up and being passed through grades without teachers who helped or instead blamed them and deemed them illeterate. Why on earth are so many people in a hurry to diagnose toddlers or children? They can barely walk talk or think for themselves? They should not be diagnosed with a life-long issue for social behaviors, their home lives should be looked into. But of course that doesnt profit these institutions, and yes they are locking away 3 amp 4 year olds. Theres no age limit they can drug these kids on the most minor circumstances and claim its help. Its never help! Its blaming and shaming and sadism. Its disgusting. Its a disgrace. Tons of these places are risks for sexual abuse, and have been caught doing so. Children should not be involved in psychology. The entire history of this profession is rooted in abusive and torture behavior. You can research psychotherapists, nurses, ncui, and other health professionals who were caught abusing, hitting, tormenting, bullying, over-medicating or filming disturbing videos of children crying or in distress or being sexually assaulted, or with child porn from an outside source. Theres been hundreds just in the last couple of years, and thats thanks to social media that theyve been caught and talked about so how many flew under our noses? And in these cases a lot of them got away with the abuse for decades before being caught, the police did not investigate until the last moment, and they enjoyed harming or outright ruining how many lives? This blind-faith in health-professionals is exactly how they got away with it. No. Its sick to claim a child is ill simply because they arent social or show signs of depression or anger. Hello! Thats life. Being blindly obedient, oblivious, and happy and drugged will not make them healthy people able to stand on their own. It makes them dependant and easier to harm and control. These are the signs of rapists, not helpers or saviors or heroes. httpslittlethings.comlifestylebrianna-student-suspendedhttpslittlethings.comlifestylebrianna-student-suspended",AmIOverreacting,2025-09-30 12:51:49,Reddit

Content Strategy,"Creator-led, AI-first Motorolas festive strategy aims for market momentum","For Motorola India, the festive quarter is not merely a seasonal sales opportunity but a critical period that can define its annual performance. With as much as 30 of the brands yearly sales concentrated in this quarter, the company recently launched its new campaign, Big Billion Moto Rush, in partnership with Flipkart, to capitalise on the surge in consumer demand.The campaign is a playful remix of the Oscar-winning track Naatu Naatu Naacho Naacho from RRR, which has been reintroduced as a festive anthem. The hero video, released across Motorolas YouTube and Instagram channels, features a line-up of creators and celebrities, including chef Ranveer Brar, comedian Ravi Gupta, actor Abhay Deol, finance creator Anushka Rathod, and digital personality Barkha Singh. View this post on InstagramA post shared by Motorola India motorolainThe idea, according to Shivam Ranjan, global head, Motorola India, was to stand out in a crowded festive market where nearly every brand relies on discounts and promotions.Shivam Ranjan, global head, Motorola IndiaFor us, the objective is to drive consideration and purchase intent, but also to make Motorola part of the cultural conversation. Music cuts through clutter better than any other element, which is why we chose Naacho Naacho. It has pan-India and global affinity, says Ranjan.Unlike last year, when Motorola created a lifestyle-led festive film, this years assets are largely product videos set against the track.The strategy also extended beyond paid media, with meme pages and pop culture handles such as Laughtercolours, sarcasticschool, and filmyvision amplifying the campaign organically. User-generated content has been another driver of engagement. Motorola launched a contest inviting audiences to recreate their version of the Hello Moto Naacho Naacho remix, with selected entries winning Motorola smartphones. Thousands of micro- and nano-creators participated, pushing the campaign to more than 200 million views across platforms, as per the brand.Festive season and sales focusThe festive periods contribution to overall category sales is well documented, with smartphones and electronics often seeing up to a third of their annual sell-outs during this window. For Motorola, too, the festive share of sales is significant. But there is more to the festive season for them than just sales.This is not just about sales. It is also the most important period for brand visibility. We measure consumer intent through a share of Google searches. We aim to increase searches by at least 50 during festive seasons. Over the last two years, we have exceeded that target, including an 80 year-on-year growth from 2023 to 2024, Ranjan explains.Marketing spends are correspondingly weighted this quarter, with 7590 of the budget allocated to festive campaigns. Once Diwali passes, demand slows until late December, making this short window even more crucial.Outside of festive launches, there are other big drivers of spending. If a launch does not create demand, no amount of festive discounting will make the product sell, he says.Market PositioningAfter some tough years up until 2022, Motorola focused on resetting its business model and regaining profitability. From 2023 onwards, it shifted to what Ranjan calls a phase of hyper growth, growing from 2 to 8 market share in three years. Motorola Mobility Indias operating revenue was over Rs 500 crore for the financial year ending March 31, 2024. We are the sixth biggest brand by volume and fifth by value, Ranjan reveals.FYI Indias smartphone market shipped approximately 70 million units in the first half of 2025, reflecting a modest 0.9 year-over-year growth, with Q2 alone showing a stronger 7.3 increase to 37 million units, according to IDC. The total market value is estimated to be around 48.22 billion, driven by growth in premium segments and rising average selling prices, which reached a record 275 Rs 24,396 in Q2 2025.The top players by market share in India are Vivo, which leads with about 19, followed by Samsung with 14.5, Oppo at 13.4, Realme, Xiaomi, and Apple. Apple holds a smaller volume share but significantly impacts market value due to premium offerings like the iPhone 16, which was the highest-shipped model in India during the first half of 2025.Creator-first strategyA notable shift this year is the brands decision to go beyond its core base of tech influencers. While Motorola regularly works with the tech community, the festive campaign leveraged creators from genres such as comedy, food, finance, and lifestyle to reach new cohorts.Our offers are for everyone. To create a festival around Motorola, we wanted to reach not just tech-centric audiences but consumers across different interests. Seeing Ranveer Brar or Abhay Deol dancing was unexpected and fun, which increases the chances of organic sharing, Ranjan says.Targeting is broad, covering the 1844 segment, but Gen Z and younger millennials form the core audience. Platforms such as YouTube and Instagram are particularly effective for these cohorts, with virality playing a central role in the campaigns design.Motorola remains heavily digital-first, with more than 80 of its media spend directed to digital. Traditional media plays a selective role. The brand utilises airport digital out-of-home advertising to target premium consumers and collaborates with television news networks, focusing on content integration rather than solely relying on ad spots.Retail is another important pillar, with visibility, fixtures, and promoter presence being ramped up across partner outlets.Price segments and key productsThe festive portfolio spans Motorolas three main franchisesG Series sub-Rs 20,000 Moto G96 and G86 Power cater to value-conscious consumers. The G96 features a curved OLED display and a Sony sensor-led camera system, while the G86 Power appeals to those prioritising battery life with a 6,700mAh battery and a flat display.Edge Series Rs 20,000Rs 60,000 The Edge 60 Fusion, priced below Rs 20,000 for the festive period, is currently the brands best-selling model. The Edge 60 Pro, positioned as a semi-flagship, sees its price reduced to below Rs 25,000, offering premium-grade AI and camera features.Razr Series Rs 50,000 The foldable Razr 60, launched at Rs 49,999, is now available at Rs 39,999, signalling Motorolas intent to make foldables more accessible.Ranjan notes that pricing remains a critical lever, especially in the competitive sub-premium segment, where Motorola faces both established players like Samsung, Vivo, and Xiaomi, and also emerging brands like IQOO and Nothing.Differentiation through design and innovationTo stand apart, Motorola has invested in design partnerships and finishes. Its collaboration with Pantone, a company that provides professional color standards and a universal color language for industries like fashion, graphic design, and manufacturing, has allowed it to introduce distinctive colours and materials, ranging from vegan leather to Alcantara, acetate, wood finishes, and Swarovski crystal editions.Smartphones are an extension of consumers self-expression. Design makes us appeal to them beyond hardware specifications, Ranjan believes.Motorola devices with Pantone coloursSoftware is another focus area. Motorola offers privacy and security features such as ThinkShield and Moto Secure, while Smart Connect allows users to link their devices with televisions, PCs, and tablets.AI has emerged as a defining theme. In addition to its in-house Moto AI, Motorola integrates Perplexity, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot, giving users a choice across platforms.No one AI is superior at everything. Our approach is to make Moto AI the interface through which consumers can access all, Ranjan says.Distribution strategyDistribution has also expanded. While Motorola was historically online-heavy, with Flipkart as its anchor partner, offline channels now contribute 3540 of volumes.Partnerships with Reliance Retail and Redington have extended its reach into premium general trade outlets, supported by investments in fixtures and in-store promoters.Quick commerce is another emerging channel, with Motorola devices already being delivered in minutes via Flipkart. Direct-to-consumer remains a smaller but growing piece, aimed at loyal customers and ecosystem products.The festive season is both a battleground and an opportunity. Our goal is to drive consideration and purchase intent while ensuring Motorola is part of the larger cultural conversation, says Ranjan.",afaqs,2025-09-30 12:51:49,NewsData

Content Strategy,What are some underrated B2B marketing strategies that actually work in 2025?,"Ive been diving deep into B2B marketing lately and noticed that while a lot of people talk about the big channels LinkedIn ads, email marketing, content, some of the underrated strategies dont get much love. For example, Ive seen teams do really well with - Turning product demos into bite-sized, value-first content instead of the usual sales pitch. - Using customer success stories not just as case studies, but weaving them into broader thought leadership content. - Focusing on how buyers actually buy today, sometimes a self-serve demo page can do more than a 30-minute sales call. Curious to hear from this community, what strategies or experiments have you tried in B2B that worked better than expected? PS If anyones working on optimizing demos or sales enablement, Id love to trade notes thats something Im super interested in right now.",b2bmarketing,2025-09-30 12:51:49,Reddit
Content Strategy,How to Make a Personalized NCLEX Revision Timetable,"Hey everyone! Ive been getting a lot of questions about how to structure NCLEX prep without burning out, so I thought Id share some tips on making a personalized revision timetable that actually works for you. Step 1 Be realistic about your time First, figure out how many weeks you have until your exam. Be honest about other commitments work, family, etc. so you dont over-plan and feel guilty for not keeping up. Step 2 Break down content into chunks Split topics e.g., peds, OB, mental health, pharm, prioritydelegation across the weeks. Rotate subjects so you dont get stuck in one area for too long. Step 3 Mix question practice with review Try something like AM 75100 practice questions with rationales PM Review weak areas notesvideos Active recall flashcards, teaching concepts aloud gt passive rereading. Step 4 Schedule rest self-care Add in breaks, exercise, and at least one day a week with lighter studying. Your brain consolidates better when rested. Step 5 Adapt and adjust Track what you got wrong most often and adjust the timetable weekly. No one-size-fits-all plan your weak spots guide the next week. Example if you have 4 weeks Week 1 Foundations Med-Surg basics Week 2 Pharm Peds Week 3 OB Mental Health DelegationPriority Week 4 Mixed Qbanks high-yield review labs, infection control, test strategies Most important Dont copy someone elses schedule blindly. Use it as a framework, but build around your own energy levels, commitments, and learning style. Hope this helps someone whos overwhelmed about where to start! All the best For those whove passed, how did you structure your timetable?",Markknclex,2025-09-30 12:51:49,Reddit

Content Strategy,"Hit 25 users in 2 weeks first traction, but still figuring out monetization","Hey everyone, I wanted to share a small milestone from my journey building BlogShortshttpsblogshorts.com a tool that automatically turns blogs or text content into short, shareable videos for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts. In just 2 weeks, we managed to get 25 users generating videos! Its exciting to see people actually using something I built, testing it out, and sharing content they wouldnt have had the time to create otherwise. The reality check none of the users have paid yet. Its a bit humbling, but thats the early-stage grind understanding what people value, where the friction is, and how to convert traction into revenue. To give back and show what the tool can do, I made a quick tutorial on how to generate a video using BlogShorts. You can check it out here youtubehttpsyoutu.be3DQDWEjvLX4 Its been amazing seeing people turn blogs into engaging short videos automatically some are doing marketing content, some educational, some just testing for fun. The engagement they get from these videos is super motivating and proves that repurposing written content into video is something people actually want. Id love to hear from the community How did you convert your first users into paying customers? What strategies worked for early adoption and monetization?

Content Strategy,I Analyzed Top Healthcare Instagram Accounts 1M Combined Followers. Heres Their Unwritten Social Media Playbook,"So Im building a Marketing AI, and I spend a lot of time analyzing what separates successful brands on social media from those who struggle to see results. A commenter on a previous post asked me to look into chiropractors, so I got curious. Okay so the title says healthcare and yeah i limited this to chiropractors but its close enough i swear haha. I pointed my analysis engine at some of the top-performing chiropractor accounts on Instagram to see if I could identify any data-backed trends or best practices specific to your niche. The results were pretty interesting and I wanted to share them online! 1. Personal branding dominates over practice-based organizational accounts. 90 of all posts across top performers in the niche feature the practitioners face, they were on camera demonstrating an exercise, explaining a concept or working with a patient What this means for you is if your social media marketing is from the perspective of your organizational brand, then you should consider rebranding into a personal brand. 2. A surprising discovery for this niche a higher promotional frequency works, but only if you do it right. One of the most interesting findings was that top accounts post promotional content far more often than the typical 2 promo 8 non-promo rule you hear everywhere. The data showed an essentially opposite mix of 8 promotional or practice-related posts for every 2 purely educationalnon-promotional posts was the best practice for this niche. However, theres a crucial catch the vast majority of these promos are soft-sells. They avoid aggressive, hard-sell phrases like Book Now! Instead, they focus on demonstrating value, showing patient results with consent, and educating the audience on the benefits of their care. This builds credibility and lets the results do the selling. 3. Engagement Questions are the best CTA for this niche For CTAs a clear winner emerged. Direct commands like Book now, DM me now, were around 50 less effective in terms of overall engagement compared to Engagement questions like What do you guys think about X?, Comment your experience with Y, Who here is suffering from Z, tell me your story, etc. Post frequency and hashtags Posting frequency Aim for 10 posts a week. Yes 10. If you have trouble, just record something, ANYTHING, with your face on the camera, and post it. It works. For this niche have 4-5 relevant hashtags per post. --- Sample content plan Obviously its not easy turning strategy into action, so The AI Im building is designed to turn these strategic insights into a concrete, day-by-day action plan. Based on this analysis, it generated a sample campaign plan that automatically schedules a mix of value and soft-sell posts, suggests specific question-based CTAs, and ensures the chiropractor is the star of the show. So take this template as an example if youre in a similar niche Processing img takro3emo8sf1... I hope these data-backed insights are helpful! Im just a founder trying to see if this kind of analysis is actually valuable to real business owners. So please give feedback if you can!",SocialMediaMarketing,2025-09-30 12:51:49,Reddit

Stock Market,"Start Here Military Money 101, Prime Directive, Flow Chart, Updates Monthly","Welcome to the getting started thread for military money. This will cover 90 of what you need to know to be successful with your military paycheck and build wealth in the military. Some of the most frequent questions in on this subreddit goes I have X, what should I do with it? or How should I handle my debtfinancesmoney? Military Personal Finance and Investing Flow Chart httpsimgur.comaakrEcUShttpsimgur.comaakrEcUS Step 1 Budget and reduce expenses, set realistic goals Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your required expenses to the extent practical. Housing costs, utilities, and basic sustenance are harder to eliminate than entertainment, eating out, or clothing expenses. There are many great apps available to discover what youre spending money on and where there are opportunities to save money. Monarch Money, YNAB, Copilot Money, EveryDollar are just a few of the apps available. Once your budget is figured out, you need to figure out what your goals are. Financial independence? Retire early? Military retirement? Buy a house? Save for a car? Setting SMART goals - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timely goals can mean the difference between financial success and failure. For example, you might want to finish your first enlistment with a 100,000 net worth or achieve early retirement after 20 years of service. These are SMART goals. Step 2 Build an emergency fund An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you dont touch unless something unexpected comes up. Unexpected travel, essential appliance replacement, and cars breaking down are all real world examples of emergency funds in action. If you need to draw from your emergency fund at any time, your first priority as soon as you get back on your feet should be to replenish it. Treat your emergency fund right and it will return the favor. Start with a 1,000 emergency fund. Eventually build it up to 3-6 months of expenses or a few of months of expenses plus How should I size my emergency fund? For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. Or maybe you want to cover a few months of expenses, plus a roundtrip airfare for you and your family to go back to your home stateside. What if I have credit card debt? Credit cards generally have very high interest rates typically 15-25 APR and that is a pretty big deal. If this applies to you, you should prioritize paying down the debt first. A smaller emergency fund of 1,000 or 1 month of expenses is temporarily acceptable while paying off credit card debt or other debts with interest rates above 10. What kind of account should I hold my emergency fund in? A checking account, savings account, or a high yield savings account HYSA. Something FDIC insured and accessed in a few days. Step 3 5 Into the Thrift Savings Plan The Thrift Savings Plan TSP is the military and governments version of a 401k retirement savings plan. All servicemembers enlisting since 2018 are covered by the Blended Retirement System BRS. The BRS has 3 primary components to help servicemembers save for retirement 1. 5 matching contribution to the TSP 2. Continuation pay bonus between the 8th and 12th year of service depends on branch 3. Military pension. A 2 mutliplier is used for each year of service. So if you retire after 20 years of active duty service, youll earn an inflation adjusted, lifetime pension of 40 of your base pay. 20 years 2 40 After 60 days of service, the Department of Defense DOD will automatically contribute 1 of your base pay to the Traditional TSP. Starting in the 25th month of service, your contributions are matched, up to 5. So if you contribute 5, the DOD will contribute 5. This is a risk free, 100 return on your contributed funds. The default investment for anyone in the BRS is a Lifecycle fund with their birth year 65. For example, if you were born in 2005, youll be placed in the Lifecycle 2070 Fund. The Lifecycle Funds are a mix of the 5 TSP Funds, designed by professional fund managers. The 5 TSP Funds are C Fund - Tracks SampP 500, made up of the 500 largest companies in America. You can use the ETF SPY or VOO to track it. S Fund - Tracks Dow Completion index, basically all the mid- and small- capitalization companies in America outside of the SampP500. ETF equivalent VXF. I Fund - International stocks. MSCI ACWI IMI ex USA ex China ex Hong Kong Index. 5,500 companies in this index. representing 90 of the investable world market cap outside the US. Similar to ETF VXUS but without Chinese or Hong Kong stocks. F Fund - Fixed income. Corporate bonds. Use ETF AGG to see performance. G Fund - Lowest risk, lowest long term return fund. The G Fund invests in a special non-marketable treasury security issued specifically for the TSP by the U.S. government. This fund is the only one in the TSP that guarantees the return of the investors principal. No comparable ETF. Step 4 Pay down high interest debts Once youre taking advantage of the 5 BRS TSP match, you should use your extra money to pay down your high interest debt e.g., debts much over 4 interest rate. In all cases, you should make the minimum payments on all of your debts before paying down specific debts more quickly. There are two main methods of paying down debt With the avalanche method, debts are paid down in order of interest rate, starting with the debt that carries the highest interest rate. This is the financially optimal method of paying down debt, and you will pay less money overall compared to the snowball method. With the snowball method, popularized by Dave Ramsey, debts are paid down in order of balance size, starting with the smallest. Paying off small debts first may give you a psychological boost and improve ones cash flow situation, as paid off debts free up minimum payments. The downside is that larger loans that may be at higher interest rates are left untouched for longer, costing more in the long run. As an example, Debtor Dan has the following situation Loan A 1,100 with a minimum payment of 100month, 5 interest Loan B 3,300 with a minimum payment of 300month, 10 interest Sudden windfall 2,000 Dan needs to first pay 100 300 400 to make the minimum payments on loans A and B so the payments are recorded as on time. The extra 1,600 can either go towards Loan A smallest balance, snowball method, eliminating it with 600 left to go towards Loan B, or Loan B entirely highest interest rate, avalanche method. Whats the best method? tends to favor the avalanche method, but do not underestimate the psychological side of debt payments. If you think that the psychological boost from paying off a smaller debt sooner will help you stay the course, do it! You can always switch things up later. The important thing is to start paying your debts as soon as you can, and to keep paying them until theyre gone. You can use unbury.mehttpunbury.me to help you get an idea of how long each method will take, and how much interest youll be paying overall. Should I be in a hurry to pay off lower interest loans? What rate is low enough to where I should just pay the minimum? Depending on your attitude towards debt, you may want to stop paying more than the minimum payment on loans with low interest rates once you have paid all other loans above that threshold. A common argument is that the long-term return from investments in the stock market will likely exceed the interest rate from a low-interest loan. While this has been true in the past, keep in mind that paying down a loan is a guaranteed return at the loans interest rate. Stock performance is anything but guaranteed. The rough consensus is that loans above 4 interest should be paid off early in the debt reduction phase, while anything under that can be stretched out. Step 5 Max out Retirement Accounts - Roth IRA and Roth TSP The next step is to contribute to a Roth IRA for the current tax year. You can also contribute for the previous tax year if its between January 1st and April 15th. See the IRA wikihttpwww.reddit.comrpersonalfinancewikiiras for more information on IRAs. Roth IRA and Roth TSP contribution limits are different and do not cross over. You can contribute the maximum out your Roth IRA and your Roth TSP. Matching contributions do not count against your personal TSP contribution limit. Roth and Traditional IRA limits on IRS.govhttpswww.irs.govretirement-plansplan-participant-employeeretirement-topics-ira-contribution-limits Roth and Traditional TSP limits on TSP.govhttpswww.tsp.govmaking-contributionscontribution-limits The most often recommended places to open a Roth IRA are at Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab. Most banks offer substandard Roth IRA products and you should not open Roth IRA accounts there. Should I do Roth or Traditional? Read Roth or Traditionalhttpswww.reddit.comrpersonalfinancewikirothortraditional. For most servicemembers O-3 and below, youll be better off contributing to the Roth IRA, since military pay is so low taxed. Much of our military pay is untaxable allowances, such as Basic Allowance for Housing BAH, Overseas Housing Allowance OHA, and Basic Allowance for Sustenance BAS. Why contribute to an IRA if I have the TSP? Roth IRAs have access to low cost investments similar to what youll find in the TSP. However, you can always withdraw Roth IRA contributions at any time, tax and penalty free. After youve fully funded your Roth IRA, you can look at maxing out your Roth TSP. Before saving for other goals, you should save at least 15 and up to 20 of your gross income for retirement. If you are behind on retirement savingshttpswww.fidelity.comviewpointsretirementhow-much-money-do-i-need-to-retire, you should try to save more than 15 if you can. If you cant save 15, start with 10 or any other amount until you are able to save more. Where should I open my Roth IRA? Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab. Read up about the Bogleheads 3 Fund Portfolio before selecting an investment option. Step 6 Save for other goals Military servicemembers and spouses covered by TriCare are not eligible for Health Savings Accounts HSA0. If you wish to save for college for your kids, yourself, or other relatives, consider a 529 fund in your statehttpwww.clark.comclarks-529-plan-guide. Save for more immediate goals. Common examples include saving for down payments for homes, saving for vehicles, paying down low interest loans ahead of schedule, and vacation funds. Save more so you can potentially retire early also see advanced methods, below, only using taxable accounts after maxing out tax-advantaged options. Make an impact through giving. One of the rewards of practicing a sound financial lifestyle is that giving becomes easier. If youre on top of your health care costs, future education costs, and youve made it to this step, you can help make a difference for others by givinghttpswww.reddit.comrpersonalfinancewikicharity. If you cant afford to make monetary donations, there are other ways to give. Maybe youre interested in financial independence or retiring early, also known as FIRE? There are many resources out there on military financial independence and early retirement. The time frame for these goals will dictate what kind of account you save in. For short-term goals under 3-5 years, youll want to use an FDIC-insured savings account, CDs, or I Bonds. If your time horizon is longer or you can afford to adjust your plans, you might consider something riskier like a balanced index fund or a three-fund portfolio both are a mix of stocks and bonds. The best savings or investment vehicle will vary depending on time frame and risk tolerance. Keep in mind that especially for a young person the more time your money has to grow, the more powerful the effects of compounding will be on your savings. If the goal is early retirement even before the age of 59, you should definitely maximize the use of any available tax-advantaged accounts IRA, 401k plans, HSA accounts, etc. before using a taxable account because there are ways to get money out of tax-advantaged accounts before 59 without penaltyhttpswww.reddit.comrpersonalfinancecomments434ey1psaretirementfundsarenotlockedupuntilage. If you are using a taxable account for any goal, youll want to have a decent grasp on asset allocation in multiple accountshttpwww.bogleheads.orgwikiAssetallocationinmultipleaccounts and tax-efficient fund placementhttpwww.bogleheads.orgwikiPrinciplesoftax-efficientfundplacement. Military State Taxes Your home of record is the place you enlisted or commissioned from. This cannot be changed unless there was an error. State of legal residence is the state that you claim as your residence. If you only have military income, you will pay state income tax only to this state. You can establish residency several ways Registering to vote in that state Obtaining a drivers license in that state Titling and registering your vehicle in that state Drafting a Last Will and Testament naming that state as your domicile Purchasing residential property in that state Changing your military and finance records to reflect residency in that state. The simplest way to establish residency is to PCS to that state and establish residency while you are a resident. State with no income tax include Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming. Many other states have no tax for military servicemembers stationed outside the state. Simply engaging in one of the above acts alone will not likely render you taxable by a state however, the more points of contact you make with a state increases your chances of becoming a taxpayer to that state. It is important to concentrate the majority of your points of contact in the one state where you intend to pay state taxes otherwise, you may find yourself owing taxes to more than one state as a part-year resident.

B The residence or domicile of the spouse. C The permanent duty station of the servicemember. Military spouses and military servicemembers can pick 1 of 3 options for their state of legal residence A The residence or domicile of the servicemember. B The residence or domicile of the spouse. C The permanent duty station of the servicemember. So either match the servicemember, keep your old state, or change to the current state youre in. Military Bonuses Military bonuses have federal income taxes withheld automatically at 22. You may have state taxes withheld as well. Because your marginal tax rate is often much lower than this, you will receive a large portion of that withheld tax back when you file your tax return the following year. If you dont know what to do with a military bonus, directing some of it to your Roth TSP is a great place to park it. After reading all that, go ahead with any other questions you have about getting started with your military money.",MilitaryFinance,2025-09-30 12:51:49,Reddit

Stock Market,"History of Minden City, Michigan - A Captivating Story of Small Town Life - Video","History of Minden City, Michigan - A Captivating Story of Small Town Life - Video The history of Minden City, Michigan reflects the story of small-town life in the Thumb. From farming and railroads to Main Street businesses, this village shaped Sanilac County. This article shares the history of Minden City, Michigan, a small Thumb village shaped by farming, the railroad, and community life between 1880 and 1940. Using vintage photographs, we explore how this town built its identity around Main Street businesses, grain elevators, and the Pere Marquette Railroad. Video - Main Street, Minden City, 1920s. Early Beginnings of Minden City The history of Minden City, Michigan begins in 1855 when the village was first platted during the lumber boom. Settlers were drawn by fertile farmland and the promise of opportunity in Michigans Thumb. A post office opened in 1862 under the simple name Minden. By 1883, the growing community officially incorporated as Minden City. The 1871 Thumb Fire devastated much of Sanilac County, destroying farms, homes, and entire towns. Minden City escaped the worst of the flames. In the years that followed, it became a local hub for farming families and merchants who rebuilt their lives after the fire. The Railroad Arrives A turning point in the history of Minden City, Michigan, came in 1880 with the arrival of the Port Huron amp Northwestern Railroad. The line, later acquired by the Pere Marquette Railroad, provided farmers and businesses with a direct link to markets in Port Huron, Harbor Beach, and beyond. The Minden City depot became the beating heart of the village. Trains carried out grain, hay, and lumber while bringing in goods that stocked local stores. Families gathered at the station to send off travelers or meet salesmen. The depot symbolized progress, opportunity, and the connection of a small village to the wider world. Main Street Businesses and Industry By the late 19th century, Minden City had a bustling Main Street lined with businesses. Shops, hotels, and professional services created a sense of permanence in a farming community. Minden City Bank, led by C. L. Messmore, gave farmers access to capital. F. O. Hetfield amp Sons sold dry goods, clothing, and hardware. Minden City Woolen Mills, operated by W. H. Lesynworth, produced textiles. Mooney House, a hotel and tavern, offered lodging for travelers and railroad men. Blacksmiths, harness makers, barbers, and furniture shops served everyday needs. L.H. Riedels grain elevator, located near the tracks, loomed large over the shipping yard and reminded residents that agriculture was the backbone of the town. Baughmans Hardware and the DeRosia Hotel By the early 1920s, Main Street reflected both tradition and modernization. Baughmans Hardware Store, its brick faade painted with bold lettering, sold tools, paints, and supplies to area farmers. Above its entrance, a sign advertised Dodge Brothers motor cars, signaling that the automobile era had arrived even in the Thumb. Beside the hardware store stood the DeRosia Hotel, a two-story white frame building that welcomed travelers, salesmen, and visiting farmers. Together, Baughmans Hardware and the DeRosia Hotel symbolized the balance of old and newhorse-drawn wagons still clattered down Main Street while motorcars increasingly pulled up to the curb. This image of tradition meeting progress is central to the history of Minden City, Michigan, showing how a farming village adapted to new technologies without losing its identity. Civic Life and Local Newspapers Community institutions gave structure and voice to Minden City. City Hall, built of brick, was more than just an office. Its bell rang out during public meetings, celebrations, and times of mourning. Churches and schools bound families together, passing on faith and education to the next generation. The Minden City Herald, founded in 1889, chronicled the rhythm of everyday life. Its pages carried farm reports, local announcements, and stories of national events. For a small rural village, the Herald was essentialit kept families informed and reminded them they were part of a larger story. Notable Figures and Families Several individuals shaped Minden Citys story. C. L. Messmore guided the local bank, while Archy Mooneys hotel became a gathering place. Thomas Canham ran a general store, and Joseph Morris worked as a furniture maker. The Kosal Brothers operated a meat market that became a local landmark, remembered in photographs showing proud proprietors standing before their storefront. Population shifts also tell the story of the town. In 1900, Minden City recorded more than 400 residents. By 1930, during the Great Depression, the number had fallen to 277. Still, the village endured, with businesses, schools, and farms holding the community together. The Great Depression Years Like many rural Michigan towns, Minden City faced hardship during the Depression. Farming prices dropped, families struggled, and businesses closed. Yet the core of the town remained intact. The grain elevator still operated, trains still stopped at the depot, and the Herald still printed each week. Minden City did not grow large, but it never disappeared. It stood as an example of how small Michigan villages endured cycles of growth and decline while maintaining their identity. Why the History of Minden City, Michigan Matters The history of Minden City, Michigan, reflects the broader story of the Thumb. It was a place where farming defined daily life, where railroads brought connection, and where Main Street businessesfrom hardware stores to hotelsbuilt the foundation of community. Through photos of its depot, City Hall, grain elevator, and hotels, we see a record of resilience and adaptation.

Stock Market,When market reacts to earnings call,"Two things 1. the call starts at 830...so its before the market opens. The early traders are only 10-12 of a days trades. Im guessing once you see major movement, the early traders got what they needed and reacted. 2. Market opens at 930, how quickly will the masses react to the earnings call? Its going to be interesting. I do not see the ship sinking. My AI trading platform, based on yesterday around 8pm says there is only a 20 chance the stock would fall and stay below .45, even with neutral to not so positive news. Generally, on general market reaction questions like this, the AI has a pretty good track record with what I ask it.

My long term goal is to either A if things work out well, work as an Applied Scientist or related roles in MAANG etc. B MLE at MAANG etc. I plan on doing a Masters too, if the global situation gets better I have liked Software Engineering too but not as much as some senior folks in my company do, they are fully cracked and geeked out. Overall, I care about learning, type of people around me and career trajectory Compensation for current role which someone posted on Leetcode httpsleetcode.comdiscusspost6904037hevo-data-sde-1-june-2025-ppo-offer-inte-uovihttpsleetcode.comdiscusspost6904037hevo-data-sde-1-june-2025-ppo-offer-inte-uovi",Btechtards,2025-09-30 12:51:49,Reddit

Python,"AI Superpowers for Everyone, Not Just Coders","TLDR AI is turning coding from a niche skill into a universal toolbox. Anyone in any trade can now build software, automate tasks, and level-up a career. The future will reward people who mix their existing craft with AI know-how. SUMMARY The talk features Maria from the Python Simplified YouTube channel. She explains why writing code is only a small slice of real software work. AI tools already handle the typing, letting people focus on logic, teamwork, and product ideas. Python is the easiest first language because it reads like plain English. Emotional intelligence still matters on tech teams, but perfectionism can slow progress. University degrees lag behind industry needs, so students must self-study modern AI frameworks. Prompt-engineering alone is not enough real value comes from building new models and architectures. Every jobfrom plumbing to graphic designcan weave AI into daily workflows. Robotics, VR, and reinforcement learning are ripe fields where beginners can still stand out. Open source, personal AI agents, and better privacy controls are keys to a healthy tech future. The speakers end on optimism lifelong learning plus AI tools can unlock huge opportunities for anyone willing to dive in. KEY POINTS Coding becomes a tiny part of modern software AI handles routine syntax. Python remains the best starter language due to its readable style. Degrees teach outdated tech students must chase up-to-date skills on their own. Prompt engineering is popular, but building and fine-tuning models unlocks deeper impact. AI will reshape every trade, letting experts automate their own workflows. Reinforcement learning and robotics are early-stage fields with room for newcomers. Personal, on-device AI agents could solve privacy worries and democratize power. True creativity and future AGI will hinge on open data, transparent models, and the ability for systems to say no. The best career move now is to mix your existing craft with hands-on AI experimentation.

Python,Reusable expression,"I have some expression basically nested CASE WHEN that reference various fields that are repeatedly used in a project. The expressions are subject to change over time as the project evolves, and manually updating every occurrence is a nuisance. So I was wondering if there is a simple way to write the expression once and reusing it. Storing the expression in a variable and calling it using eval works but it slows down rendering too much, so its a no-go. I suppose I could write a function but I dont know Python and while learning it is on the todo list its not happening anytime soon. Any other idea?",QGIS,2025-09-30 12:51:49,Reddit
