Python,Otary now includes 17 image binarization methods,"**What does my project does**: Otary is an open-source Python library dedicated to image manipulation and 2D geometry processing. It gets even smarter with the addition of 17 binarization methods now available! Jump to the documentation straight away(https://alexandrepoupeau.com/otary/api/image/transformers/thresholding/). **Target Audience**: Python developers or researchers focused on image processing and computer vision tasks. **Comparison**: you could actually use Numpy, OpenCV directly. They are used behind the scene by Otary. Otary now includes 17 binarization methods, designed to make experimentation both simple for beginners and powerful for advanced users. **5 basic methods**: easily accessible for quick and efficient use: simple, otsu, adaptive, bradley, and sauvola. These methods are the most classic and effective, perfect for new users and for 90% of practical cases. **12 advanced methods**: for users who want to explore, compare, and understand more sophisticated approaches. They are intended for image processing specialists and researchers who want to experiment with new ideas. The documentation presents a summary table of the 17 methods, classified by year of publication and accompanied by links to the original scientific articles. My revelation: FAIR binarization. FAIR stands for Fast Algorithm for document Image Restoration and it has completely changed the way I approach binarization. Rather than binarizing the entire image, it: 1. First detects edge pixels with a custom Canny edge detector 2. Applies a clustering algorithm to small windows centered around the edge pixels. 3. Performs post-processing to complete the total binarization of the image This is the approach I found most innovative among all those I have explored and implemented. It uses the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to identify text pixels versus background pixels by assuming a Gaussian mixture distribution: it's simply brilliant! I sincerely hope that this update will make the work of developers, engineers, and researchers who manipulate images easier and inspire new explorations. I would also like to encourage everyone to contribute, add new binarization methods, improve existing ones, or even invent new approaches.

Java,How I Built My First OpenAI AgentKit Agent in 6 Minutes: A Beginners Guide,"# TLDR: * OpenAI AgentKit is a toolkit for building, deploying, and optimizing agent workflows. * The Agent Builder provides a visual, no-code interface to design agents. * Steps: Log in Open Agent Builder Add/connect nodes Configure Test Deploy. * You can deploy your agent via ChatKit or export with the Agents SDK. * No coding required for basic workflowsget started in under 10 minutes! # Introduction Curious about OpenAIs AgentKit and how to build your first intelligent agent in minutes? Whether youre a developer seeking a powerful workflow engine or a curious beginner evaluating the OpenAI AgentKit, its Agent Builder, this guide walks you step by step through creating your first agent with AgentKit. Well cover what AgentKit is, how the Agent Builder works, and give you a practical, no-fluff tutorialall distilled from OpenAIs official documentation. # What is OpenAI AgentKit and Agent Builder? **AgentKit** is OpenAIs modular toolkit for rapidly building, deploying, and optimizing agent workflows. At its core is the **Agent Builder**, a visual canvas that lets you create, connect, and orchestrate models, tools, logic, and knowledge sourcesall without low-level coding. **Key Concepts:** * **Agent**: A system that intelligently accomplishes tasks, from simple goals to complex workflows. * **Agent Builder**: A drag-and-drop GUI for designing agents, connecting models, tools, guardrails, and custom logic. * **ChatKit**: Embeds your agent workflow in your product UI. * **Agents SDK**: For exporting and running agents in Python or TypeScript. https://preview.redd.it/3kbf6kq9uptf1.png?width2050&ampformatpng&ampautowebp&amps42d1ecd9e54eacfa3018d45e419047edd07a3b3f # Prerequisites: What You Need Before You Build * **OpenAI Platform Account**: Sign up or log in at **OpenAI Platform**(https://platform.openai.com/signup) * **Familiarity With Task Goals**: Have a clear idea of the workflow or task your agent should accomplish (e.g., answering questions, summarizing documents). * **No Coding Required**: AgentKits Agent Builder is visual and accessible to non-coders, but basic logic and API concepts help. # Step-by-Step: Build Your First AgentKit Agent # Step 1: Access the Agent Builder * Go to the OpenAI Platform dashboard. * Navigate to ""Agent Builder"" under the Agents section. Heres the link: https://platform.openai.com/agent-builder(https://platform.openai.com/agent-builder) https://preview.redd.it/xc2f851buptf1.png?width1560&ampformatpng&ampautowebp&amps5baa87f92af27acceaaa0567adf80c7e3be3bb1f * Click Create a Workflow. # Step 2: Design Your Agent Workflow * **Add a Agent Node:** Drag a model node (like GPT-4) onto the canvas. This is your agents brain. https://preview.redd.it/pl509jzbuptf1.png?width2814&ampformatpng&ampautowebp&amps6eba40100a13deccfb37150b5a84e0975a0d45f0 * **Add Agent instructions**: and pick the right model and parameters for your task https://preview.redd.it/8qw2x3rruptf1.png?width1398&ampformatpng&ampautowebp&amps11003fc4f71565079d195f8431ac39eca915b3eb * **Pick from the Node types**: choose your next step, whether data formatting, or mult-step agent workflows https://preview.redd.it/rwvadihpuptf1.png?width1150&ampformatpng&ampautowebp&ampsa5de7c3fc7c5e9467bc7c169f81bdf21a7304b2f * **Equip With Tools:** Add third-party tools or services via MCP to expand your agents capabilities. * **Provide Knowledge:** Attach vector stores, file search, or embeddings if your agent requires persistent or external knowledge. * **Add Logic:** Use logic nodes to set conditions, route decisions, or chain multiple agents together. # Step 3: Connect, Configure, and Test * Link nodes by dragging connectorsdefine the flow of information. * Configure node settings (e.g., choose which model to use, set tool parameters). * Use the built-in testing interface to simulate agent runs and debug your workflow. # Step 4: Deploy Your Agent * **Embed With ChatKit:** Generate a workflow ID and embed your agent in your product UI using ChatKit. * **Export With Agents SDK:** Copy auto-generated Python or TypeScript code for custom integration. # Step 5: Monitor and Optimize * Use the dashboard to monitor performance and logs. * Leverage OpenAI Evals, prompt optimizer, and trace grading to refine your agents responses and reliability. # OpenAI AgentKit vs. Metaflow AI Agent Builder: Key Differences * **Focus:** OpenAI AgentKit is developer-centric with code flexibility Metaflow AI Agent Builder targets growth teams with no-code workflows. * **Interface:** AgentKit combines visual elements with code capabilities Metaflow provides a 100% no-code experience. * **Target Users:** AgentKit serves technical teams who value customization Metaflow empowers marketers and business users without coding skills. * **Use Cases:** AgentKit excels at general automation and R&ampD Metaflow specializes in marketing workflows and business operations. # Quickstart: Build Your First Agent in 6 Minutes 1. **Log in** to the OpenAI Platform. 2. **Open Agent Builder** and start a new workflow. 3. **Drag and connect** model and tool nodes on the canvas. 4. **Configure** each node for your use case. 5. **Test** the workflow with sample inputs. 6. **Deploy** using ChatKit or export SDK code. Thats it! Youve just built your first OpenAI AgentKit agent. # Conclusion and Next Steps Building agent workflows with OpenAI AgentKit is fast, modular, and accessibleeven for beginners. With the Agent Builders drag-and-drop interface, you can create sophisticated agents in minutes, customize them with external tools and knowledge, and deploy them with minimal friction. Ready to unleash AI agents in your workflow? Dive in today, experiment, and start optimizing your own intelligent automations. # OpenAI AgentKit vs Metaflow AI Agent Builder: Which Should You Choose? If youre just getting started with AI agents, one of the first decisions youll face is which platform to use. **OpenAI AgentKit** and **Metaflow AI Agent Builder** are two of the most talked-about optionseach with its own philosophy, strengths, and ideal use cases. # OpenAI AgentKit: For Tinkerers and Developers Who Want Flexibility OpenAI AgentKit is built for rapid prototyping and experimentation.

C++,Regarding the 2 lawsuits that were discovered today.,Here's my view on this actually.C.ai only has to walk the walk the walk.but talking the talk is something they are not doing. As the ppl who are responding so negatively are actually just bad ppl who raised kids and want to point the finger at c.ai. now all we can do is watch character ai deal with this behind the scenes.and just guess what they will do. I speculate they are just gonna act like they are already fixing a problem and just ignore the 2 lawsuits. They are only acting like they care about the loud minority.They already did get rid of minors on the app by nerfing everything for them.this is how companies act and they're catering to right audience. And also they are not gonna bend the knee to the ppl who don't know how to parent i hope. Also it was nice knowing you all if c.ai goes down with the Internet someday.,CharacterAI,2025-10-07,Reddit,Regarding the 2 lawsuits that were discovered today.
