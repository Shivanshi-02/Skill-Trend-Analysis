Technology,Python,AI-Rulez v2.0 Universal AI Assistant Configuration Management,"Im happy to showcase AI-Rulez v2, which is a major next step in the development of this tool. The Problem If youre using multiple AI coding assistants Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, youve probably noticed the configuration fragmentation. Each tool demands its own format - CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, .windsurfrules, .githubcopilot-instructions.md. Keeping coding standards consistent across all these tools is frustrating and error-prone. The Solution AI-Rulez lets you write your project configuration once and automatically generates native files for every AI tool - current and future ones. Its like having a build system for AI context. Why This Matters for Development Teams Teams using AI assistants face common challenges - Multiple tools, multiple configs Your team uses Claude Code for reviews, Cursor for development, Copilot for completions - Framework-specific standards Type safety, testing patterns, dependency management uv, poetry, npm, etc. - Monorepo complexity Multiple services and packages all need different AI contexts - Team consistency Junior devs get different AI guidance than seniors AI-Rulez solves this with a single ai-rulez.yaml that understands your projects conventions. Key Features AI-Powered Project Analysis The init command is where AI-Rulez shines.

Technology,Python,Claude Code SDK for non-coding,"Is anyone using the Claude Code SDK to build agents? Note the typescriptpython CC sdk library I used it recently to prototype a coding agent and it was as good as you imagine. I just gave it access to a couple more MCP tools and built an UI for it. Its still somewhat early though. Eg, the API is missing a little functionality and its not documented how to deploy it. Im interested in using it for non-coding tasks, so I was wondering if anyone is using it in that way. All there is to do is give it access to MCP tools. We could give it access to n8nzapier workflows!

Technology,PyTorch,Sebastian Raschka just released a complete Qwen3 implementation from scratch - performance benchmarks included,"Found this incredible repo that breaks down exactly how Qwen3 models work httpsgithub.comrasbtLLMs-from-scratchtreemainch0511qwen3 TLDR Complete PyTorch implementation of Qwen3 0.6B to 32B params with zero abstractions. Includes real performance benchmarks and optimization techniques that give 4x speedups. Why this is different Most LLM tutorials are either - High-level API wrappers that hide everything important - Toy implementations that break in production - Academic papers with no runnable code This is different. Its the actual architecture, tokenization, inference pipeline, and optimization stack - all explained step by step. The performance data is fascinating Tested Qwen3-0.6B across different hardware Mac Mini M4 CPU - Base 1 tokensec unusable - KV cache 80 tokenssec 80x improvement! - KV cache compilation 137 tokenssec Nvidia A100 - Base 26 tokenssec - Compiled 107 tokenssec 4x speedup from compilation alone - Memory usage 1.5GB for 0.6B model The difference between naive implementation and optimized is massive. Whats actually covered - Complete transformer architecture breakdown - Tokenization deep dive why it matters for performance - KV caching implementation the optimization that matters most - Model compilation techniques - Batching strategies - Memory management for different model sizes - Qwen3 vs Llama 3 architectural comparisons The from scratch approach This isnt just another tutorial - its from the author of Build a Large Language Model From Scratch. Every component is implemented in pure PyTorch with explanations for why each piece exists. You actually understand whats happening instead of copy-pasting API calls. Practical applications Understanding this stuff has immediate benefits - Debug inference issues when your production LLM is acting weird - Optimize performance 4x speedups arent theoretical - Make informed decisions about model selection and deployment - Actually understand what youre building instead of treating it like magic Repository structure - Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step walkthroughs - Standalone Python scripts for production use - Multiple model variants including reasoning models - Real benchmarks across different hardware configs - Comparison frameworks for different architectures Has anyone tested this yet? The benchmarks look solid but curious about real-world experience. Anyone tried running the larger models 4B, 8B, 32B on different hardware? Also interested in how the reasoning model variants perform - the repo mentions support for Qwen3s thinking models. Why this matters now Local LLM inference is getting viable 0.6B models running 137 tokenssec on M4!, but most people dont understand the optimization techniques that make it work. This bridges the gap between LLMs are cool and I can actually deploy and optimize them.

Technology,PyTorch,Regain Hard Drive Space Tips aka Where does all my drive space go ?,"HDSSD Space Overview this guide will show you where space has gone the big ones upon installing SD installs. Risks Caveat Empor, it should be safe to flush out your Pip cache as an install will download anything needed again, but the other steps need more of an understanding of what install is doing what - especially for Diffusers . If you want to start from scratch or had enough of it all, that removes risk. Cache Locations Yes, you can redirectmove these caches to exist elsewhere but if you know how to do that, Id suggest this guide isnt for you. ----- Youll notice your hard drive space dropping faster than sales of Tesla when you start installing diffusion installs. Not just your dedicated drive if you use one but your c drive as well this wont be a full list of where the space goes and how to reclaim some of it permanently or temporarily. 1. Pip cache usually located at cusersusernameappdatalocalpipcache 2. Huggingface cache usually at cusersusername.cachehuggingface 3. Duplicates - Models with two names or locations thank you Comfy Pip Cache Open a CMD window and type Pip cache dir this tells you where pip is caching the files it downloads gtcusersusernameappdatalocalpipcache Pip cache info this gives you the info on the cache ie size and whls built gtPackage index page cache location pip v23.3 cusersusernameappdatalocalpipcachehttp-v2 gtPackage index page cache location older pips cusersusernameappdatalocalpipcachehttp gtPackage index page cache size 31877.7 MB gtNumber of HTTP files 3422 gtLocally built wheels location cusersusernameappdatalocalpipcachewheels gtLocally built wheels size 145.9 MB gtNumber of locally built wheels 36 Pip cache list this gives you a breakdown of the whls that have been built as part of installs of uis and node installs NB if your pc took multiple hours to build any of these , make a copy of them for easier installation next time eg flash attention gtCache contents gt - GPUtil-1.4.0-py3-none-any.whl 7.4 kB gt - aliyunpythonsdkcore-2.16.0-py3-none-any.whl 535 kB gt- filterpy-1.4.5-py3-none-any.whl 110 kB gt - flashattn-2.5.8-cp312-cp312-winamd64.whl 116.9 MB gt - flashinferpython-0.2.6.post1-cp39-abi3-winamd64.whl 5.1 MB Pip cache purge yup, it does what it says on the tin amp deletes the cache . Pros In my example here, Ill regain 31gbish . Very useful for deleting nightly pytorch builds that can accumulate in my case. Cons It will still redownload the common ones each time it needs them Huggingface Cache Be very very careful with this cache as its hard to tell what is in there httpspreview.redd.itfychqcwkbbof1.png?width990ampformatpngampautowebpamps99116357c7de5f2255ff2dba455b2119331d0768 ABOVE Diffuser models and others are downloaded into this folder and then link into your models folder ie elsewhere .

I just moved the older ones to a temp folder and used the SD installs that I still use to check. Duplicates Given the volume and speed of models being introduced and workflows that download them or it being done manually and a model folder structure that cries itself to sleep everyday, it is inevitable that copies are made of big models with the same name or with tweaks . Personally I use Dupeguru for this task, although it can be done manually quite easily if your models folder is under control and subfoldered properly....lol . Again - be careful deleting things especially Diffusers, I prefer to rename files for a period with an added copy in the filename, so they can be found easily with a search or rerun of Dupeguru others are available. Deepguru can also just move files as well ie instead of firing the Delete shotgun straight away. httpspreview.redd.itc3mjrq9wibof1.png?width1193ampformatpngampautowebpamps0cea72d0742afcc3a7fffcbeaca0642555bbb9dc ABOVE I have had Dupeguru compare my HuggingFace cache with my models folder.

I tried updating comfyui and dependencies but it ended up creating a numpy error for some reason that made the node not work at all.

Technology,PyTorch,Feel Betrayed by Aurlien Gron amp his Hands On ML with TenorFlow,"After spending months learning machine learning and deep learning with TensorFlow using Aurlien Grons Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow, I discovered that the author is now working on a PyTorch version of his book. I came across several comments from people who preferred PyTorch, but when I searched online, TensorFlow was often praised for its production and deployment capabilities, while PyTorch was favored in research settings. Since Im preparing to enter the job market, I figured TensorFlow would be the more practical choice. However, it now feels like TensorFlow is becoming increasingly abandoned. Gron even mentions in his book that PyTorch is gaining momentum. Still, he points out that the competition between the two frameworks benefits both, and once youve learned TensorFlow, many of the skills are transferable. Thats trueIve learned a lot about deep learning, mostly focused on sequence modeling and NLP rather than computer vision or reinforcement learning. But Ive always had this nagging feeling that it wasnt worth investing so much time learning TensorFlows quirks and complexities. I dove deep into building custom training loops and components like layers and loss functions. With that foundation, picking up PyTorch has been much easier. Yet I cant help but think if I had spent all that time learning PyTorch instead, Id have gained much more experience with it.
