React,I need advice on how to handle this daycare situation,"I need advice on how to handle this situation.

My son is 3 and goes to a church daycare 4 days a week. When I picked him up last thursday, the teacher put him in the front seat with me (they instruct you to pull around to buckle in so the car line keeps moving). My window was down, and she leaned into my window and asked my son to give her a kiss. 
He pulled away and she said ""oh he only kisses his mama"" and I was stunned I think, and could only get out ""yeah"" before rolling my window up and driving away. 

What would you do? Do I call the director? Email her? Message the teacher directly? Am I over reacting? My instinct tells me I'm not overreacting and to not be passive about how my kid is treated. 
My mom said ""well hes so cute!"" OK? She also said ""it would he different if it was a man teacher and a little girl"" no it wouldn't? 

Anyway - help. We have school tomorrow and I feel like if im going to address anything, I should do it today.",Mom,2025-10-05T23:44:48,Reddit
React,Am I overreacting to how my best friend treats me? (Context: autism + suspected BPD),"I (21F) have been best friends with this girl (22F) for about 5 years. We’ve known each other since high school but got close in college. For context, I’m autistic and very likely have BPD (multiple therapists have suggested it, but getting a diagnosis in the UK is difficult). I definitely have a “favourite person,” and unfortunately, she’s it.

I would genuinely do anything for her, even things I don’t like or that make me uncomfortable, just because she wants to. But when I want to do something, she usually says no unless it benefits her too.

Because I’m autistic, I have strong special interests and tend to info-dump when I’m comfortable. If I talk about things I’m hyperfixated on (anime, music, etc.), she clearly doesn’t care — she changes the subject or looks bored. When she talks about her interests, I listen and engage, even though I don’t understand any of it, because it matters to her. I go to the effort of buying her stuff related to her interests. Even outside of bdays and Xmas. 

Another issue is that whenever she gets a boyfriend, I basically stop existing. With her last two boyfriends, she would cancel or refuse plans with me because she was with them. As soon as she was single again, she suddenly wanted to see me constantly. She has a new boyfriend now, and it’s happening again.

Through those relationships she made new friends, and she talks about them a lot. which is fine she can have other friends. Of course.  but when I make new friends (which is really hard for me because of severe social anxiety and abandonment issues), she barely reacts or seems happy for me. It feels invalidating.

I’ve also told her about my body image issues — I’m really insecure and can’t even look at myself in the mirror. But she’ll send me pictures of her weight on a scale and make comments about how “skinny” she is. It feels really insensitive knowing how I feel.

She knows about my suspected BPD and that my mood and stability can be heavily affected by her because she’s my FP. Instead of encouraging boundaries or balance, she seems to like that I’m emotionally dependent on her. She jokes about it. 

When I send her even a 1-minute voice note, she jokes about it like I’m sending a whole “podcast.” Meanwhile, I have another friend who listens to every voice note I send, even long ones, and responds when she can, thoughtfully and supportively.

Looking back, when my mental health was really bad a few years ago (I was genuinely suicidal), she was around, but she’d make weird jokes or try to act like she was going through the same thing in a way that felt fake or performative. Not dark humour, but uncomfortable and dismissive.

Like I said. The BPD is very much suspected. I’ve tried to get diagnosed but the thought of ringing up my doctor about it is terrifying. So that’s really. Hindering the progress. But. Again. Like I said. She knows I suspect it. And she seems. Too into it. Like. She will tell people I have just met for the first time that I have BPD and she is my favourite person which is like. Weird. I’m not diagnosed so I don’t go telling people I think I have it. Let alone outright say I DO have it. And she goes around outing me to people I. Do not know. Which just. Makes me feel so uncomfortable. 

Here’s the main problem: I don’t think I can just cut her off. Because of the (very much potential BPD attachment) but just. Attachment in general, I know it would be mentally dangerous for me. Even if we don’t talk for a couple of days, I start panicking and feel like she hates me. Cutting her off would send me into a really bad place, and I don’t think it would be safe at all. Distancing feels impossible without me spiraling.

I also want to be fair and acknowledge my own part in things. I know I’m not perfect in this friendship either. Because of the attachment stuff, I get really jealous when she talks about her other “best friends.” It feels like a punch to the gut, because in my head, I’m supposed to be that person to her.

When we hang out with other people (like the two of us plus someone else), I tend to shut down and go quiet because I feel like she’s more interested in them, and I start feeling like a third wheel. She doesn’t really seem to notice when that happens.

I also text her a lot. about random everyday things. because not hearing from her can make me spiral and assume she hates me. I know that might come off as clingy or annoying sometimes, but it comes from panic, not malice.

I’m aware I have my own issues in this dynamic, and I’m not trying to paint myself as perfect. That’s part of why I’m asking if I’m overreacting — I can’t tell if my feelings are valid or if I’m blowing things out of proportion.

I love her and I don’t want to lose her, but it also feels like she only values me when it’s convenient for her. I don’t know if I’m being overly sensitive, or if this is actually a one-sided/toxic friendship.

Am I overreacting to all of this, or is this genuinely not okay?

React,"I (28F) confessed to sexchatting with someone else, and now my boyfriend (31M) is acting extremely affectionate","I (28F) have been with my boyfriend (31M) for almost 5 years. Our relationship has always been loving and stable, but lately we’d grown a bit distant. Less communication, less intimacy, I felt invisible and disconnected.

A few weeks ago, I started talking to someone online. It began as harmless chatting, but eventually turned into sexchatting. It never became physical, but I know it was still cheating. I felt awful and full of guilt, so I confessed everything to my boyfriend a couple of days ago.

When I told him, he was devastated. He cried, shook, and told me he felt betrayed and disgusted. But at the same time, he said he felt *confused,* because even though he was hurt, he also felt a strong physical attraction to me. He said things like he wanted to “have” me, to “use” me, and that he didn’t understand why he felt that way. He said it was like he loved me, hated what I’d done, but couldn’t stop wanting to be close to me.

That night, things got very emotional and physical between us. It wasn’t violent, but it was raw and intense, as if all our pain, anger, love, and longing collided. Afterward, we both cried. He held me all night and kept saying he loved me and that he could never hate me, no matter what I’d done.

Since then, we’ve spent almost every moment together. We’ve talked, cried, and tried to say goodbye, because I’m moving out tomorrow. It’s been incredibly emotional, and somehow we’ve ended up being even more physically close. We’ve had sex several times since I confessed, and every time it feels like a mix of love, grief, and desperation, like we’re trying to hold on to something that’s already breaking.

He says he still loves me, but needs time and space to heal. We agreed to take a break, and I respect that. This has made me realize how deeply I love him and how badly I hurt him.

But I can’t understand his reaction. Why would someone feel *more* attracted and affectionate toward the person who hurt them so deeply? Is this a trauma response, an emotional coping mechanism, or something else?

I’m not looking for moral judgment, I know what I did was wrong. I just want to understand what’s happening emotionally between us right now, because it feels so confusing.

**TL;DR:**  
I (28F) sexchatted with someone else and confessed to my boyfriend (31M). He was heartbroken but also said he felt a strong sexual attraction to me afterward. Since then, we’ve been very emotional and physically close, even though I’m moving out and we’re taking a break. I’m trying to understand why he’s reacting with more love and desire instead of pulling away.",relationships,2025-10-05T23:44:06,Reddit
React,For multiple patches now the game has given us moments of Nikki displaying stronger emotions and reactions.,"One of the major complaints in 1.0 was that Nikki barely would ever react to things. Sure we had moments like the prologue and at the start of Chigda fight, but otherwise it didn't seem like she gets to really pay attention to what is happening. This resulted in hilarious moments like the human slaves part and how nonchalant Nikki has been about that.

One of the most fascinating aspects about the franchise in previous games was the amount of twists, tragedy and trauma Nikki undergoes and how much of an active and well-characterized protagonist she is. She never was merely an observer and she always speaks her mind and when a mistake is made or tragedy happens, we see how it weighs on her. 

This was basicaly the main thing the game had been missing.

Lately (actually since at the least 1.3 where we saw her be emotional over Philomia's fate), the game seems to really attempt to convey Nikki's emotions better.

In 1.5 we see Nikki deliver a monologue about the Forgotten Pieceys and how their sacrifice saved everyone but also robbed them of ability to ever return home, losing who they were, their roots and having to find a way to live and more forward despite that. The monologue is emotional and clearly draws upon Nikki's own position as she's essentially doomed to repeat endless loops trying to save Miraland, likely never allowed to return home

In 1.7 we see her get emotional over Sith and Aleysiya's fates. It's subtle, but it clearly affects her. She's desperate to validate the duo's sacrifice so that everyone remembers it.

In 1.8 we had everything from the way she reacted the first time she saw Yue Bai to the post-boss-confrontation dialogue between them to their final reunion scene and Nikki's monologue about the value of life and the world she salvaged from destruction of another. Not to mention when she channels  Artist NIkki's memories and relationship with the village (as it's a life she didn't get to live but has experiences of as Artist Nikki is her fanfic of sorts). There's a genuine effort to showcase Nikki being emotional and reacting to what is happening.

In 1.9 we mainly see it in the confrontation with Ennio and in the ending cutscene.  She goes through a series of emotions, starting with being confused and inquisitive, leading to being angry and shocked like the other two characters and then trying to understand and empathize with Ennio's trauma. 

Now, in this patch (1.10) not only we get a lot of goofier laidback moments but also, in its conclusion, we got to see NIkki unable to do anything as a character sacrifices themselves. IMO, the game *really* nails the emotion there. She couldn't do anything to prevent it, she couldn't hero her way through what happened and she can only live with the sacrifice that transpired just like the rest of characters involved. 

Now we have no way of knowing if 1.11 will continue this trend or if it not, but this makes me honestly excited for 2.0 story as this implies they hopefully learned to make her more reactive and if side-stories already are doing it, then hopefully 2.0 will have NIkki be more introspective and emotional about what is happening around her too. 

After all the main story is meant to be meatier and longer and if this kind of focus on her characterization and emotion carries over to there, we are in some fascinating things (hopefully)",InfinityNikki,2025-10-05T23:43:59,Reddit

So with his fav home cooked meal, i wanted to get him something small that he would like, and decided to get him a sweatshirt, and found these ones, with designs i really like, my fav one is the potential one, and it's kinda his vibe, but i'm still not sure, maybe there is better gift ideas out there for chess and that are cheap ? I want something that he would wear to his chess club and say ""yeah my gf got me this"" tbh 😂, Can you help me pick a sweatshirt please ? Or maybe you have better suggestions ? I'd appreciate any comment and thank you so much

React,Coming across as unconfident will make people feel AWKWARD,"Us autistics are socially clumsy, obviously. However, I once went to a function very confident, and I noticed that people had a WAY better reaction towards me, compared to when I came across as insecure.

I’m telling you, when you’re confident or insecure, people can sense that shit, and they react to you accordingly. It’s like insecurity makes people feel awkward around you. 

I was talking to someone a while ago, and he told me how much he loved my confidence, even though I was socially clumsy. People can tell immediately. ",aspergers,2025-10-05T23:41:04,Reddit
React,I (38M) am just realizing my wife (32F) of 5 years is likely autistic. Looking for advice on how to address it.,"TLDR: Several behaviors that my spouse exhibits bother me, and appear to be related to adult female autism. Do I try to ameliorate each one individually, or address as a whole?   
  
Recently, I put in series of behaviors that my wife does into Chat GPT, and it essentially said, ""she is autistic."" As far as I know, she has not been diagnosed, and I personally wonder what a diagnosis would help with given the fact there is no cure or treatment. Maybe just clarity, support etc. 

Some of these behaviors are perfectly fine with me, like preferring soft clothes. Great! No issue there. Personality quirks (being very literal) just makes her 'her' to me and I love them. 

Others are mildly annoying to me, but I can totally live with. For example, she always, 100% of the time, needs to have EDM dance music on in the background. I don't care for that type of music and find it mildly annoying, but overall I can live with it and don't care that much. It's usually on pretty quietly. 

Which brings me to the behaviors that I am really starting to struggle with. I have addressed them directly several times but it starting to seem that she will not change them. 

1.) Always needing a dark environment - We are not allowed to turn on our overhead lights at night. She does have a lamp that we are allowed to turn on when I complain that I cannot see. We have had guests politely ask to turn lights on because they can't see. If I have a light on, she will stand up and turn it off - it is never ignored or allowed to stay on. In the bedroom, she has disconnected the lights and installed a salt lamp that gives off a glow. During the day (we both WFH), all blinds must be drawn at all times. 

I took out all our recessed lighting and turned the switches on the back to ""low"" and replaced the bulbs in our hanging lights with the mildest lights I could buy, but they are still not allowed to be on.   
  
I am really struggling with this.   
  
Being in a dark house, windows drawn, with EDM music in the background is just not how I like to live during the day. You are probably asking how this wasn't fully known before we got married, which is a good question. Well, at that point in time, we always worked in the office so I didn't see what her ideal daytime environment looks like, which she is now able to fully control and design to her liking. At night, it's more of just a functional issue. Perhaps being older I simply cannot see things. 

2.) Slamming/clanging around (never in anger) - Secondly, she slams doors, bangs cups on the counter, chips dishes, and heel stomps while walking around. She is a very petit woman, and has never done this in anger. It more appears to be lack of coordination/inability to gauge fine motor skills. This illicits a very uncomfortable reaction in me. I wince when she slams car doors, slams our house door such that the windows upstairs rattle, and slams things on the counter such that they make a loud noise. 

I have addressed this many times, usually at the point of it happening. She usually says, ""nothing broke"" or otherwise doesn't agree with me. So it doesn't seem like she wants to improve. I understand this is somewhat subjective, and she is right that nothing has broke due to her slamming a car door or slamming our house door. But every time I react viscerally. 

I have tried to put slippers out in the morning to reduce the ""heel stomps"" that shake the house, and I am going to try today to talk to her about holding on to door handle until it latches rather than ""throwing it."" 

3.) Messiness - This was 100% known to me before we got married and something I chose to live with. Clothes in piles on the grounds, leaving lids/caps off of everything, leaving wrappers on the counter instead of placing in the trash. 

With this, I'm 80% at a place I can live with because we have cordoned-off spaces, so my clothes are in drawers, my toothpaste tube has the cap on it, etc. Predictably, the kitchen and other common areas can cause some contention. 

\---------

I'm just a little lost. Do I focus on the small things and focus on solutions to bring us to a point we can live with? Or do I take the big picture item and see if she is interested in getting an autism test? When I think about the big picture it starts to balloon out of control in my mind.

React,I feel trapped and don’t think I can get out,"Posting this because I need to vent a bit and before you continue reading, I know I’m not perfect. Also leaving someone is not a decidion you take overnight, those who are married will understand.

I’m married for 12 years, we have 2 wonderful children. My wife is fantastic, she takes care of everything and everyone, we have nice friends, a good life overall and no shortcomings. But that’s the problem. Since she arrived in my life her filosofy is that I need to cut with everyone from the past, except those who she likes. Sometimes I see a post from a girl I went to school with and still might cross ocasionally since we live in the dame city and I might react, like saying happy birthday nothing else but for my wife it’s the end of the world. According to her thinking we stopped being individuals the day we married and everything we do or plan should be to please each other. I can somewhere relate and of course I will not go on a trip all by myself for 2 weeks without her consent but I think that despite being in marriage it’s normal to still have personal ambitions and interests.

Because of this I just feel my love is fading away. From what she tells me she is not happy either because she just feel so dissapointed by everything I do. Even if she know i’ve masturbated once without telling her her whole world collapse because she starts thinking why, how, when and I’m like we both have right to a private space. We used to talk and communicate a lot but it feels like we’re completely the opposite right now. Thinking how she will feel if I leave, given how she thinkd just breaks my heart.",Marriage,2025-10-05T23:38:50,Reddit
React,HEELP ME PLEASE,"About six months ago, I started experiencing SOCD, but now I'm almost certain I'm bisexual. The very thought of sleeping with men repulses me, although porn arouses both heterosexual and homosexual men, though I react even more strongly to homosexual porn. Meanwhile, in real life, I can't perceive guys as potential partners, and I've never been aroused by a man. With girls, it's the opposite. I've always liked them, always found them interesting. From a very young age, I simply adored the female body; it excited me wildly. And I've had sex with girls in real life, and it almost always brought me great pleasure, with the exception of a few awkward moments. In general, I still don't understand whether I've had a seizure or truly discovered a new side of myself. Please help me understand. And yes, I'm 21 years old and I'm a man.

Python,I built an AI with an AI - and it actually works. Here's how it went!,"Tldr: I used [Zo](https://www.zo.computer/) (using 4.5 sonnet as the LLM backend) to build an implementation of the [LIDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIDA_(cognitive_architecture)) cognitive architecture as an end-to-end stress test, and it was the first LLM tool I've seen deliver a complete and working implementation. Here's the repo to [prove](https://github.com/mindpixel20/lida) it!

Long version: A few days ago, I came across [zo.computer](http://zo.computer/) and wanted to give it a try - what stood out to me was that it comes with a full-fledged linux VPS you've got total control over, in addition to workflows similar to Claude Pro. Naturally I wanted to use 4.5 Sonnet since it's always been my go-to for heavy coding work (there's a working FLOW-MATIC interpreter on my github I built with Claude btw). I like to run big coding projects to judge the quality of the tool and quickly find its limitations. Claude on its own, for instance, wasn't able to build up [Ikon Flux](http://cadia.ru.is/wiki/_media/public:publications:ikonfluxrutrcs07006.pdf) (another cognitive architecture) - it kept getting stuck in abstract concepts like saliences/pregnance in IF context. I figured LIDA would've been a reasonable but still large codebase to tackle with Zo + 4.5 sonnet.

The workflow itself was pretty interesting. After I got set up, I told Zo to research what LIDA was. Web search and browse tools were already built in, so it had no trouble getting up to speed. What I think worked best was prompting it to list out step by step what it'll need to do, and make a file with its ""big picture"" plan. After we got the plan down, I told it ""Okay, start at step 1, begin full implementation"" and off it went. It used the VM heavily to get a python environment up and running, organize the codebase's structure, and it even wrote out tests to verify each step was completed and functions as it should. Sometimes it'd struggle on code that didn't have an immediate fix; but telling it to consider alternatives usually got it back on track. It'd also stop and have me run the development stage's code on the VM to see for myself that it was working, which was neat!

So, for the next four or five-ish hours, this was the development loop. It felt much more collaborative than the other tools I've used so far, and honestly due to built-in file management AND a VM both me and Zo/Claude could use, it felt MUCH more productive. Less human error, more context for the LLM to work with, etc. Believe it or not, all of this was accomplished from a single Zo chat too.

I honestly think Zo's capabilities set it apart from competitors - but that's just me. I'd love to hear your opinions about it, since it's still pretty new. But the fact I built an AI with an AI is freakin' huge either way!!

Python,How to help cc understand private library APIs without bloating the context window?,"Hey r/ClaudeAI 

I'm integrating cc into my dev workflow and running into a common bottleneck: how to give it accurate context for private libraries (in separate git repos) my app depends on (custom classes, async patterns, internal helpers, etc.).

Feeding the full codebase of all private libraries into prompts isn't realistic - it quickly blows past token limits, and cc starts hallucinating once context gets fuzzy.

What I've tried so far:

- Pasting snippets + doc comments: Works for small cases, but scales horribly - messy and eats up tokens fast. 
- Linking a Markdown summary: Often ignored or inconsistently used.
- Prompt boilerplates: Fine for basic functions, but breaks down for complex APIs and async workflows. 

What I actually need: A low-token, lightweight method for cc to reliably recall the correct methods, parameters, and edge cases (e.g. `LibraryClient.authenticate_with_retry()`) without hallucinating or guessing.

Ideas I'm exploring:
- RAG / local vector store 
- JSON “cheat sheet” with key methods
- Local MCP servers for API metadata 

How are you managing private library APIs with cc? What's working for you in terms of tools, prompt design, or local context injection - ideally setups that run offline and don't require a GPU? 

would love to hear real-world experiences or lightweight solutions you've built.

btw. I am working with Python, TypeScript, Java and Dart

Go,I built an AI with an AI - and it actually works. Here's how it went!,"Tldr: I used [Zo](https://www.zo.computer/) (using 4.5 sonnet as the LLM backend) to build an implementation of the [LIDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIDA_(cognitive_architecture)) cognitive architecture as an end-to-end stress test, and it was the first LLM tool I've seen deliver a complete and working implementation. Here's the repo to [prove](https://github.com/mindpixel20/lida) it!

Long version: A few days ago, I came across [zo.computer](http://zo.computer/) and wanted to give it a try - what stood out to me was that it comes with a full-fledged linux VPS you've got total control over, in addition to workflows similar to Claude Pro. Naturally I wanted to use 4.5 Sonnet since it's always been my go-to for heavy coding work (there's a working FLOW-MATIC interpreter on my github I built with Claude btw). I like to run big coding projects to judge the quality of the tool and quickly find its limitations. Claude on its own, for instance, wasn't able to build up [Ikon Flux](http://cadia.ru.is/wiki/_media/public:publications:ikonfluxrutrcs07006.pdf) (another cognitive architecture) - it kept getting stuck in abstract concepts like saliences/pregnance in IF context. I figured LIDA would've been a reasonable but still large codebase to tackle with Zo + 4.5 sonnet.

The workflow itself was pretty interesting. After I got set up, I told Zo to research what LIDA was. Web search and browse tools were already built in, so it had no trouble getting up to speed. What I think worked best was prompting it to list out step by step what it'll need to do, and make a file with its ""big picture"" plan. After we got the plan down, I told it ""Okay, start at step 1, begin full implementation"" and off it went. It used the VM heavily to get a python environment up and running, organize the codebase's structure, and it even wrote out tests to verify each step was completed and functions as it should. Sometimes it'd struggle on code that didn't have an immediate fix; but telling it to consider alternatives usually got it back on track. It'd also stop and have me run the development stage's code on the VM to see for myself that it was working, which was neat!

So, for the next four or five-ish hours, this was the development loop. It felt much more collaborative than the other tools I've used so far, and honestly due to built-in file management AND a VM both me and Zo/Claude could use, it felt MUCH more productive. Less human error, more context for the LLM to work with, etc. Believe it or not, all of this was accomplished from a single Zo chat too.

I honestly think Zo's capabilities set it apart from competitors - but that's just me. I'd love to hear your opinions about it, since it's still pretty new. But the fact I built an AI with an AI is freakin' huge either way!!

Go,refused to take a picture with me and then told me she'd invite me to her wedding????,"When I take a long time to respond, she always deletes the contact, she keeps asking for favors, she never apologizes.
The reason for the breakup is that she didn't want to take a picture with me, she barely introduced me to her parents, she said ""isn't it better to separate?"" After giving me a gift  I felt like I was begging to go out with her and a lot of the time she would cancel at the last minute.I finished an episode ""download the dating app and find a girl for you"" and days later I found her on that app, ""I was looking for a friend"" she said...
After the breakup, she dated another guy and broke up months ago.
If you don't respond or praise her, she disappears, creates a situation with her ""friends""
I talked to my ex, she made me jealous by saying she was going out with a friend, hours later she sent a photo at home alone, then she started saying that I didn't want to talk to her.
That he loved me, but didn't see a future for us as a couple.
Then she sent me a song and said she was going to invite me to her wedding.
A few days before she came here when I was drunk and we almost made out, then she said ""I can't force you, but I can pierce the condom"".
Then she started saying she wanted to be a mother, what the hell is going on?

TL;DR: refused to take a picture with me, deleted me every time we argued, dated someone else, came back acting jealous and flirtatious, said she loved me but saw no future, told me she'd invite me to her wedding, and then hinted about having my baby.

Go,Need some insight,"In August my husband was diagnosed with spondylosthesis. He had sciatic pain in his left leg with numbness in his leg and foot. 2 weeks ago tomorrow, he underwent an L4-L5 spinal fusion. In the hospital, his leg numbness was pretty much gone, some weakness in his foot remained.

The day after his release from the hospital, the numbness in his left leg and  returned, along with extreme pain that is not surgical. We got in touch with the Dr, and they had him come in. An Xray was given, they felt there was a small spot that indicated an issue that they were going to “keep an eye on”, and gave him a round of steroids (that have done nothing, btw).

Later in the week when his surgeon checked on him, hearing about the numbness and pain in the leg, he ordered an MRI with and without contrast. The preliminary report from the MRI is not finding anything in his back other than surgical inflammation.

 He has his post-surgical follow up appt. on Thurs.  We just don’t want to hear that he should go to PT and it will take time. Something is definitely amiss.

I am at a loss as to what we should be expecting from his Dr.’s in terms of trying to remedy this. Right now, he is worse off than he was before surgery. Thanks for reading.

Go,Repost: Very effective Sinusitis killer,"I am reposting this from about 6-8 months ago for the sake of those who haven't seen it:

My solution for Sinusitis. You want to read this.

Hello,

I have a fine tuned protocol for getting rid of Sinusitis, which worked for me, a friend, my uncle, and many members of this subreddit. 

Here is what you need:

1. Distilled water or sterile water 
2. Betadine 10%
3. Pure birch xylitol 
4. Unscented and colour free baby shampoo 
5. SciNase powder (or equivalent, needs to have sodium chloride, Potassium chloride, and sodium bicarbonate) 
6. Neti squeeze bottle or powered nasal irrigator (MUCH preferred to use a powered irrigator. If you have a waterpik like me you can buy nasal adapters. Do not use a Navage or any product that requires you to buy a proprietary saline solution) 

Here's how it works:

You use distilled or sterile water because there is a very small but statistically possible risk of using tap water that can cause problems by introducing pathogens into your nose. 

Betadine is a broad spectrum antiseptic and works very well to kill bacteria, it is used to prep skin before surgery and has plenty of strong imperical evidence supporting its germicidal effects and will likely be used by humans until heat death in the universe occurs. 

Xylitol is antimicrobial. This is also well established imperically. 

Baby shampoo has surfactants in it, which can help to emulsify protein (or lipid) biofilms that are protecting a pathogen (mostly non enveloped viruses but also gram positive/negative bacteria). 

SciNase is a Canadian product for salinating water. It has sodium chloride (salt), Potassium chloride, &amp; sodium bicarbonate. The sodium chloride makes the water isotonic or hypertonic depending on how much salt you use. Potassium chloride reduces inflammation and helps regenerate damaged soft tissue . Sodium bicarbonate adjusts the Ph of the water, for more comfort. 

The squeeze bottle or powered irrigator flushes your nose and removes mucus, I will expand on this shortly. The reason you need one of these &amp; NOT a Neti pot that uses gravity to irrigate is because there needs to be enough force to irrigate, especially if your nose is really congested or swollen. 

Here is what you do:

1. Add 250-500 ML of water to your bottle or irrigator, use as much water as you can. 
2. Add 10-30 ML of Betadine 10% (start low and titrate upwards) 
3. Add 25-50 G of 100% birch xylitol. 
4. Add 3 teaspoons of unscented &amp; non coloured baby shampoo. 
5. Add SciNase or an equivalent. You want to use a hypertonic solution, meaning 2%-5% saline in the water. Hypertonic solutions are preferred, isotonic solutions are effective but not as effective as hypertonic solutions generally speaking. 

It **WILL BE UNCOMFORTABLE OR SOMEWHAT PAINFUL WHEN YOU FIRST START**. This is normal, and you will get used to it fast. If it's too unbearable, reduce the amount of Betadine and baby shampoo. 

Use this protocol aggressively for the first 2 weeks. I reccomend 3-4 times per day. After it (hopefully) clears your sinuses reduce to 2 times per day, if that's maintaing remission, reduce to 1 time daily to see whether you can stay in remission at that frequency. 

Here is some evidence to support this protocol:

1. Studies consistently indicate hypertonic solutions as more beneficial for sinusitis, primarily due to their superior ability to:

Decrease nasal congestion and swelling.

Improve mucociliary clearance rates.

Reduce symptoms faster, including congestion, facial pressure, and pain.


Key studies:

A Cochrane systematic review (Chong et al., 2016) concluded hypertonic saline irrigation is more effective than isotonic solutions for improving nasal symptoms, though both solutions offer benefit compared to no irrigation.

Research published in the American Journal of Rhinology &amp; Allergy (Rabago et al., 2015) found that hypertonic saline irrigation significantly reduces nasal congestion and sinus symptoms.

2. Several small-scale clinical trials and observational studies have shown benefits for chronic rhinosinusitis and postoperative care:

A study in the American Journal of Otolaryngology (2019) found dilute povidone-iodine nasal irrigation reduced bacterial colonization and improved symptoms in chronic rhinosinusitis patients.

Recent evidence (2021–2022, COVID-19 pandemic context) indicates povidone-iodine irrigation may reduce viral loads in nasal passages temporarily.

Demonstrated effectiveness against common sinus pathogens including:

Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA strains)

Streptococcus pneumoniae

Haemophilus influenzae

Fungal organisms

3. Xylitol can inhibit bacterial adherence to mucosal surfaces, significantly reducing biofilm formation.

It decreases the adherence of common respiratory pathogens, such as:

Staphylococcus aureus

Streptococcus pneumoniae

Haemophilus influenzae

By reducing biofilm, xylitol enhances the effectiveness of natural nasal defenses and possibly antibiotics.

Xylitol stimulates mucosal hydration by osmotically drawing water onto the airway surface, thinning mucus.

Xylitol improves mucociliary transport, facilitating removal of mucus and pathogens.

Multiple studies suggest clinical benefits of xylitol nasal irrigation:

A randomized controlled trial (Weissman et al., 2011, in Laryngoscope) indicated that xylitol irrigation significantly improved symptoms in chronic rhinosinusitis compared to saline alone, especially by reducing nasal congestion and inflammation.

Another clinical trial (Brown et al., 2018, International Forum of Allergy &amp; Rhinology) found xylitol nasal irrigation reduced biofilm and bacterial load, improving nasal symptoms, especially in chronic or recurrent sinusitis.

4. CRS is frequently linked to bacterial biofilms (especially Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), which are resistant to conventional antibiotics and saline irrigation alone.

Baby shampoo contains surfactants (primarily PEG-80 sorbitan laurate and cocamidopropyl betaine) that can disrupt biofilms and bacterial cell membranes, facilitating microbial clearance.


Reduced Surface Tension:

Surfactants in shampoo reduce mucus surface tension, improving mucociliary clearance.

Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of diluted baby shampoo irrigation for CRS:

Chiu et al. (2008, American Journal of Rhinology) demonstrated in vitro efficacy of baby shampoo in biofilm reduction, particularly against Staphylococcus aureus.

Harvey et al. (2009, American Journal of Rhinology &amp; Allergy) found that baby shampoo significantly reduced biofilm biomass in vitro, suggesting potential therapeutic application.

American Academy of Otolaryngology (AAO-HNS) guidelines mention baby shampoo irrigation as a potential adjunctive treatment in select patients with biofilm-associated CRS, particularly those resistant to standard therapies (saline, steroids, antibiotics).

5. Solutions containing both sodium and potassium chloride closely mimic body fluid composition, reducing irritation and promoting comfort. Potassium chloride reduces inflammation in the nasal passages and helps regenerate damaged tissue. 

Buffered solutions with sodium bicarbonate optimize mucus thinning and ciliary function, facilitating the clearance of mucus, debris, pathogens, and allergens.

Sodium bicarbonate buffers the solution to neutral/slightly alkaline pH (7–8), significantly reducing nasal irritation compared to unbuffered saline solutions.

Studies consistently show buffered saline irrigation solutions are highly effective for relieving nasal congestion, inflammation, and sinus pressure, especially in:

Acute sinusitis

Chronic rhinosinusitis

Allergic rhinitis

Post-surgical nasal care


Buffered saline irrigation (with sodium bicarbonate) significantly improves nasal symptoms and patient comfort compared to non-buffered saline solutions (Rabago et al., 2002, American Family Physician; Harvey et al., 2007, Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery).

Strongly recommended by professional ENT and allergology societies (e.g., American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, American Rhinologic Society) for routine care in chronic rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and post-operative nasal care.

These buffered solutions are preferred first-line therapy for nasal irrigation due to excellent tolerability, efficacy, and minimal side effects.

Buffered nasal irrigation powder mixes containing sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and sodium bicarbonate represent the gold-standard first-line option for routine nasal irrigation, combining optimal physiological compatibility, safety, and proven symptom relief. Highly recommended for both acute and chronic sinusitis management.

6. Squeeze Bottles:

Widely studied, well-documented benefits for sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and postoperative nasal care.

Recommended by guidelines from the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) and American Rhinologic Society.

Effective mucociliary clearance; simple to use effectively with proper technique.


Powered Irrigators:

Provide more consistent, regulated pressure, potentially increasing thoroughness of mucus and biofilm removal.

Some studies suggest improved outcomes in stubborn biofilm-associated chronic rhinosinusitis or post-surgical patients due to increased mechanical disruption of mucus and pathogens.

Studies indicate slightly superior nasal and sinus cavity penetration compared to manual squeeze bottles, potentially increasing clinical effectiveness in challenging or refractory cases.

Powered irrigators highly recommended when:

Patient has difficulty achieving effective irrigation manually.

Chronic biofilm-related sinusitis or persistent mucus accumulation is suspected.

Post-surgical nasal care requiring consistent, thorough irrigation.

For chronic or challenging sinus conditions, biofilm-associated CRS, or post-surgical care, powered nasal irrigators offer potential superior performance through consistent pressure, enhanced biofilm disruption, and thorough cavity irrigation, provided the patient is comfortable with the technology and cost.

Squeeze bottles are effective and cost much less, but do not provide a consistent, high pressure flow that will aggressively and effectivley irrigate your nose. 


Now let's talk about side effects. 

This mixture / solution is highly effective, but can be irritating and somewhat painful if you are using too much Betadine or baby shampoo. This is why you need to start low and go slow. The more Betadine and shampoo you use the better, but you have to balance with it in order for it to work. 

Personally, I just pushed myself through the irritation, but for some people it is intolerable and they have to stop. If this happens, drop the amount of Betadine and baby shampoo. 

You do get used to it pretty fast. After about day 4-6 it no longer was irritating or painful. 

Sometimes your sinuses get worse before they get better, but this protocol is so effective its worth it. 

If you are getting inflammation from it in the early days of the protocol, you can buy a large bottle of Otrivin (or any other fast acting decongestant) and pour the entire contents of the bottle into the solution. Yes, this can get expensive if you need to do it for a week or two straight, but you want to get rid of the Sinusitis, right? 

I hope this post is helpful, and I encourage you to try it. It arrested my Sinusitis fast and I no longer have it. I do one daily irrigation that's isotonic, and one weekly irrigation of this protocol per week. 

You want to use the aggressive 4x per day irrigations for 14 days in order to destroy the germs and remove mucous. Once things are getting much better, you can reduce the frequency and the amount of ingredients. 

Hopefully this helps someone. 

If you have any questions, go ahead and ask!

Cheers 😊",Sinusitis,2025-10-05T23:45:19,Reddit

I do want to say, I have been diagnosed with MDD since 2016, and I'm sure it was present the year prior. I did not live a good childhood. Life was not kind, and at times still is not kind with me. I can elaborate another time, however, know this. I am trying my absolute best. I am learning so much, and I'd like to learn with someone. I am extremely insecure about my appearance and it has internalized greatly. I had perpetuated it because I was convinced by my family, and it had echoed in my heart for the longest time. I had no one to tell me otherwise, to snap me out of it. It had led me to neglect myself, harm it even, and so my appearance now is a result of that. I really did not expect myself to be here beyond 2016. It's hard to work on a body whose stress physically manifests. Years of it. Whether it manifests as searing, or immense dull aching. Cold or blazing. Empty or extremely overwhelming. I care not though. I aim to keep working towards a better future for myself. I live to love. I wouldn't be here if it weren't for the mere thought I'd get to meet you, despite my bad luck. Despite the hand I was dealt with. What I was left with. At times nothing, and at times nothing and more taken from me, somehow. I'm trying to love myself, I swear. It's just, the closest I can to that was knowing how NOT to love, it was foreign to me, but. I do find myself loving what life can offer. It's places. It's people. Friends. Even if they go off to live their lives and my name fades from them. Their promises too. I don't care. They were kind. That gives me hope. Because at one point they thought that I was worth the energy/time to be acknowledged and talk to. I learn a little about myself, through their eyes. What they liked. Eventually I like the parts of myself that they liked. I want to love someone who's sees me as me. Discover myself in their eyes. So that I too, can see them for them, in a world of billions of people. They discover themselves in mine. That they are my world, and I am theirs. The two colliding. Separate and together at the same time, a paradox. In this bigger world. A love beyond distance and time. A love that knows no bounds. That does the impossible, a paradox.

Java,"Odisha gears up for holy Kartika month: A time of faith, fasting and devotion","As the auspicious month of Kartika draws near, Odisha readies itself for a period of deep spirituality, ritual observance, and cultural vibrancy. Known as the holiest month in the Hindu calendar, Kartika is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva, and holds immense significance for devotees who observe strict religious vows, charity, and fasting during this sacred time.From temples adorned with lights to river ghats filled with the fragrance of incense and chants, the entire state transforms into a devotional landscape. For many Odias, Kartika is not merely a religious observance, it is a way of life that symbolises purity, faith, and the triumph of devotion over indulgence.When The Holy Month Begins...The month of Kartika usually falls between October and November, beginning the day after Laxmi Puja and concluding with Kartika Purnima, the full moon day. According to the Hindu calendar, it is considered the most auspicious month for worshipping Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva.Devotees across Odisha adopt a vegetarian lifestyle during this period, refraining from non-vegetarian food. Many also opt out onions and garlic during the sacred month. Many people also undertake vows of celibacy and austerity, dedicating their days to prayer, cleanliness, and charity.Religious Significance And RitualsKartika is often described as the month of penance and devotion. Each Monday during this month holds special significance for devotees of Lord Shiva, who observe fasts and offer prayers at temples, especially the Lingaraj Temple in Bhubaneswar and Loknath Temple in Puri and Dhabaleswar in Cuttack.For Vaishnavites, the month is equally sacred as it honours Lord Vishnu. Temples like Jagannath Temple in Puri and Ananta Vasudeva Temple witness a surge of devotees during this time.Habisyalis: The Devout Widows Of KartikaOne of the most striking features of the Kartika observance in Odisha is the presence of Habisyalis, widowed women, who travel from across the state to Puri to lead a life of spiritual discipline for an entire month.They follow a strict routine, eating only once a day, a simple meal known as Habisa Anna, prepared without spices. They spend their days in prayer, visiting temples, and taking holy dips in sacred tanks like Narendra Pushkarini, Swetaganga, and Markandeya Pokhari.The Puri district administration and police make special arrangements every year for their accommodation and safety, with designated lodging centres and round-the-clock security.Also Read: Devotees to get free ‘Mahaprasad’ at Puri Jagannath temple soon: Odisha Law MinisterKartika Purnima: The Grand ConclusionThe holy month culminates with Kartika Purnima, the full moon day considered the most auspicious of all. On this day, devotees take early morning baths in rivers, ponds, or the sea and offer diyas (lamps) to the holy waters, symbolizing the triumph of light over darkness.The sight of tiny boats made of banana bark or paper, carrying lamps, flowers, and betel leaves, floating on the rivers and ponds at dawn is one of Odisha’s most beautiful spiritual spectacles.Bali Yatra: Remembering Odisha’s Maritime GloryKartika Purnima also marks the beginning of the famous Bali Yatra, celebrated in Cuttack. The festival commemorates the ancient maritime legacy of Odisha’s Sadhabas, traders and sailors, who once sailed to Southeast Asian countries like Bali, Java, and Sumatra for trade and cultural exchange.People float symbolic paper boats in memory of those voyages while the Bali Yatra fair, one of Asia’s largest open-air trade fair, lights up Cuttack city with cultural performances, food stalls, and traditional crafts.Also Read: Odisha’s ‘Bali Yatra’ to make historic debut in British Parliament this NovemberA Month of Faith and ReflectionKartika month, often called the ‘month of salvation’, blends faith, simplicity, and community spirit. Whether it’s the solemn discipline of the Habisyalis, the devotion of Monday fasts, or the joyous floating of boats on Kartika Purnima, the observance reflects Odisha’s enduring connection between spiritual devotion and cultural identity.As the lamps drift away on the water, they carry with them prayers for peace, purity, and prosperity, marking the end of one of Odisha’s most sacred and soul-stirring months.",odishatv,2025-10-05T05:18:08,NewsData

Java,"Indonesia school collapse death toll rises to 36, search for bodies continues","JAKARTA: The number of students confirmed dead after the collapse of an Islamic boarding school building in Indonesia rose to 36, from 16 a day earlier, the country’s disaster mitigation agency said on Sunday.Efforts continued for a seventh day to search for the bodies of 27 students still declared missing - mostly teenage boys from the ages of 13 to 19 - trapped under the rubble, the agency said.Cranes were deployed to excavate debris and search and evacuation efforts were 60% complete, according to the agency, which said it expected to clear all debris and finish the search on Monday. ‘Maybe there’s hope’: Indonesian rescuers race against time to save students trapped under collapsed school The Al Khoziny school in the town of Sidoarjo in East Java province caved in last Monday, collapsing on top of hundreds of teenage students during afternoon prayers, its foundations unable to support ongoing construction work on its upper floors.On Friday, rescuers received the parents’ permission to make use of heavy equipment after failing to find signs of life during previous efforts.Rescuers dug through tunnels in the remains of the building, calling out the boys’ names and using sensors to detect any movement, but found no signs of life.Al Khoziny is an Islamic boarding school known locally as a pesantren.Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, has about 42,000 pesantren serving 7 million students, according to religious affairs ministry data.",brecorder,2025-10-05T05:03:37,NewsData

Java,Wie viel Asche steht mir zu? 💰,"Hey zusammen,

ich beende im Februar meinen Bachelor in Medien- und Kommunikationsinformatik (aktueller Schnitt: 1,5) und mache mir gerade Gedanken über meine Gehaltsvorstellung für die ersten Bewerbungen.
Ich muss bei so gut wie jeder Bewerbung angeben wie viel ich haben möchte und das verunsichert mich immer wieder.

Zu meinem Hintergrund:

Pflichtpraktikum und Werkstudententätigkeit bei einem großen regionalen Konzern in Baden-Württemberg – beides erfolgreich abgeschlossen.

Schwerpunkte: Softwareentwicklung (Java, Android) und Testing, hier habe ich die meiste Erfahrung gesammelt.

Ich möchte bei Bewerbungen natürlich nicht zu hoch einsteigen und mir dadurch Chancen verbauen, aber mich auch nicht unter Wert verkaufen.
Aktuell überlege ich, ob 48.000 € brutto im Jahr ein realistischer Einstieg ist oder ob ich höher bzw. niedriger ansetzen sollte.

Wie schätzt ihr das für den Standort Baden-Württemberg ein?
Was wäre eurer Meinung nach ein fairer Bereich für einen Berufseinstieg mit diesen Voraussetzungen?

Danke euch schon mal für eure Einschätzungen! ",InformatikKarriere,2025-10-05T23:44:40,Reddit

Java,How to help cc understand private library APIs without bloating the context window?,"Hey r/ClaudeAI 

I'm integrating cc into my dev workflow and running into a common bottleneck: how to give it accurate context for private libraries (in separate git repos) my app depends on (custom classes, async patterns, internal helpers, etc.).

Feeding the full codebase of all private libraries into prompts isn't realistic - it quickly blows past token limits, and cc starts hallucinating once context gets fuzzy.

What I've tried so far:

- Pasting snippets + doc comments: Works for small cases, but scales horribly - messy and eats up tokens fast. 
- Linking a Markdown summary: Often ignored or inconsistently used.
- Prompt boilerplates: Fine for basic functions, but breaks down for complex APIs and async workflows. 

What I actually need: A low-token, lightweight method for cc to reliably recall the correct methods, parameters, and edge cases (e.g. `LibraryClient.authenticate_with_retry()`) without hallucinating or guessing.

Ideas I'm exploring:
- RAG / local vector store 
- JSON “cheat sheet” with key methods
- Local MCP servers for API metadata 

How are you managing private library APIs with cc? What's working for you in terms of tools, prompt design, or local context injection - ideally setups that run offline and don't require a GPU? 

would love to hear real-world experiences or lightweight solutions you've built.

btw. I am working with Python, TypeScript, Java and Dart

thanks!!",ClaudeCode,2025-10-05T23:40:16,Reddit

I want to keep the GIF and the message visible until the TTS finishes, regardless of the animation or default layout. Currently, there does not seem to be an exact option in StreamElements to achieve this. I was thinking that maybe it could be done through custom HTML/CSS/JS.

Any ideas?",SmallStreamers,2025-10-05T23:31:52,Reddit

# INTRODUCTION

# So, What is Deep Learning?

There are many definitions out there on the internet which explain Deep Learning, but there are only a few which explain it as it is.  
There are few ideas on the internet, books, and courses I found:

* **“DL is an advanced form of Machine Learning.”**
* **“Deep Learning is just a deeper version of Machine Learning.”**
* **“It’s a machine learning technique that uses neural networks with many layers.”**
* **“It mimics how the human brain works using artificial neural networks.”**
* **“Deep Learning learns directly from raw data, without the need for manual feature extraction.”**

And a lot is still left.

But what I understood is this: Deep Learning is like teaching a computer to learn by itself from data just like we humans learn from what we see and experience. The more data it sees, the better it gets. It doesn’t need us to tell it every rule it figures out the patterns on its own.

So, instead of just reading the definitions, it's better to explore, build small projects, and see how it works. That’s where the real understanding begins.

# What is the use of DL?

DL is already being used in the things we use every day. From face recognition in our phones to YouTube video recommendations — it's DL working behind the scenes. Some examples are:

* Virtual assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant
* Chatbots
* Image and speech recognition
* Medical diagnosis using MRI or X-rays
* Translating languages
* Self-driving cars
* Stock market prediction
* Music or art generation
* Detecting spam emails or fake news

Basically, it helps machines understand and do tasks that earlier only humans could do.

# Why should we use it in daily life for automating stuff?

Because it makes life easy.

We do a lot of repetitive things — DL can automate those. For example:

* Organizing files automatically
* Sorting emails
* Making to-do apps smarter
* Creating AI assistants that remind or help you
* Making smart home systems
* Analyzing big data or patterns without doing everything manually

Even for fun projects, DL can be used to build games, art, or music apps. And the best part — with some learning, anyone can use it now.

# What is the mathematical base of DL?

Yes, DL is built on some maths. Here's what it mainly uses:

* Linear Algebra – Vectors, matrices, tensor operations
* Calculus – For learning and adjusting (called backpropagation)
* Probability – To deal with uncertain things
* Optimization – To reduce errors
* Statistics – For understanding patterns in data

But don’t worry — you don’t need to be a math genius. You just need to understand the basic ideas and how they are used. The libraries (like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch) do the hard work for you.

# Conclusion

Deep Learning is something that is already shaping the future — and the good part is, it’s not that hard to get started.

You don’t need a PhD or a supercomputer to try it. With a normal laptop and curiosity, you can start building things with DL — and maybe create something useful for the world, or just for yourself.

It’s not magic. It’s logic, math, and code working together to learn from data. And now, it’s open to all.",deeplearning,2025-10-05T10:00:14,Reddit

Keras,"[Student]-[0YOE]-[EE] Baltimore, MD - Looking for hardware internships with research and project experience","Hello, I am a sophomore studying electrical engineering. I am currently applying for positions in basically every concentration but I am mainly interested in hardware and embedded. I have applied to \~30 internships and I have only heard back from 3 positions (all auto rejections from defense companies). My current experience is mainly in ML and computer vision from my research, but I have a few embedded projects. I don't think I want to apply for any pure SWE internships just yet since I don't think I am confident that I can pass that many technical interviews since I have not taken DSA or any of the typical CS coding classes, but I might in the future. I'm also wondering if there are any specific concentrations that I might be a good fit for given my resume.

Additional Info:  
\- I am a US citizen  
\- I go to a fairly prestigious engineering university  
\- I would like to stay on the east coast area for this summer

Any help and advice is greatly appreciated!
