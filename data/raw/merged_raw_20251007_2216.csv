Python,Epistemix AI tool preview for synthetic population enrichment,"We just built an AI that turns ""I need blood pressure data for my synthetic population"" into production-ready code in 30 seconds. 

No PhD required. No statistical programming. Just plain English.

Here's what just happened in our demo:

Our team described a health attribute they wanted to add to a synthetic population.

Our AI: 

→ Parsed the request in natural language 

→ Mapped it to NHANES survey data 

→ Selected the right statistical distribution 

→ Generated validated Python code 

→ Created an upload-ready enrichment file

Then we dropped that file into Epistemix Populus and watched it enrich our synthetic population with clinically accurate attributes in real time. (The demo runs on \~9k agents to show everything working instantly—but the same process scales to 330M individuals of US population in production.)

The bottleneck in population health analytics has always been the same: Getting survey data into usable models requires specialized expertise in statistics, epidemiology, AND programming.

That barrier just disappeared.

What used to take data scientists days now takes minutes. What used to require three different specialists can now be done by a health economist with a question.

This is what happens when you combine: 

✓ 15+ years of synthetic population science 

✓ Validated survey datasets (NHANES, BRFSS, NHIS) 

✓ AI that actually understands healthcare context

The implications for pharma market access, payer analytics, and health services research are massive.

Python,O Otary agora inclui 17 métodos de binarização,"🚀 Tenho o prazer de compartilhar uma nova atualização do Otary, minha biblioteca open source em Python dedicada à manipulação de imagens e ao processamento de geometria 2D. [Clique aqui para acessar a documentação](https://alexandrepoupeau.com/otary/api/image/transformers/thresholding/). 

O Otary agora inclui 17 métodos de binarização, projetados para tornar a experimentação simples para iniciantes e poderosa para usuários avançados.

🔹 **5 métodos básicos**: facilmente acessíveis para uso rápido e eficiente: simples, otsu, adaptativo, bradley e sauvola. Para os mais curiosos, a imagem desta publicação foi criada usando Sauvola.

Esses métodos são os mais clássicos e eficazes, perfeitos para novos usuários e para 90% dos casos práticos.

🔹 **12 métodos avançados**: para usuários que desejam explorar, comparar e compreender abordagens mais refinadas.

Eles são destinados a especialistas em processamento de imagens e pesquisadores que desejam experimentar novas ideias.

📖 A documentação apresenta um quadro resumido dos 17 métodos, classificados por ano de publicação e acompanhados de links para os artigos científicos originais:

✨ Minha revelação: a binarização FAIR.

FAIR vem de “Fast Algorithm for document Image Restoration” (Algoritmo rápido para restauração de imagens de documentos) e mudou completamente a minha abordagem à binarização.

Em vez de binarizar toda a imagem, ela:

1. Primeiro detecta os “pixels de borda” com um detector de contornos Canny personalizado
2. Aplica um algoritmo de agrupamento em pequenas janelas centradas em torno dos “pixels de borda”.
3. Realiza um pós-processamento para concluir a binarização total da imagem

Essa é a abordagem que considerei mais inovadora entre todas as que explorei e implementei. Ela utiliza o algoritmo Expectation-Maximization para identificar os pixels de texto em relação ao fundo, assumindo uma distribuição de mistura gaussiana: é simplesmente genial!

💬 Espero sinceramente que esta atualização facilite o trabalho dos desenvolvedores, engenheiros e pesquisadores que manipulam imagens e inspire novas explorações.

🙏 Também gostaria de incentivar todos a contribuir, adicionar novos métodos de binarização, melhorar os existentes ou até mesmo inventar novas abordagens.

Se você encontrar um erro ou tiver ideias para melhorar o Otary, suas contribuições são bem-vindas, esse é o espírito do código aberto.

Quite proud of myself for this build, designed using FreeCAD as a way to force myself to learn FreeCAD more, and printed on my Voron v0 (which did require splitting the case and the plate which was another fun challenge). each side has a pimoroni trackball module (left is just mouse control, right can toggle between mouse, arrow keys, and scroll) and each side incorporates an ANO directional navigation and scroll wheel rotaty encoder from adafruit (which includes the encoder and 5 direct switches)! Running on a pi pico with Tecsee low profile linear switches.

I was heavily inspired by Joe Scotto's Scotto44. I couldnt get the usb c breakouts to work like he did for the Scotto44, but its something i will fiddle more with in the future.

Currently have it running KMK because im somewhat decent with python, and find it easier to fiddle with than QMK.

OpenAI AgentKit is a toolkit that enables users to build, deploy, and optimize intelligent agent workflows using a modular, visual interface. It includes tools for designing agents, embedding them in products, and exporting them as code.

# 2. What is the Agent Builder?

**Answer:**

The Agent Builder is a visual, drag-and-drop workflow designer within AgentKit. It allows you to create agents by connecting models, tools, logic, and knowledge sources without writing code.

# 3. What’s the difference between AgentKit and Metaflow AI Agent Builder?

**Answer:**

While OpenAI AgentKit is a comprehensive toolkit for developers with components like Agent Builder, ChatKit, and Agents SDK, Metaflow AI Agent Builder takes a different approach with a no-code focus for business users. OpenAI's solution offers more technical flexibility and customization through code, while Metaflow AI emphasizes simplified workflows for marketing and growth teams without requiring development experience.

# 4. Do I need to know how to code to use AgentKit or Agent Builder?

**Answer:**

No, you do not need coding experience for basic workflows. The Agent Builder’s interface is visual and user-friendly, though advanced customization via the Agents SDK may require Python or TypeScript knowledge.

# 5. What are the prerequisites to building my first agent?

**Answer:**

You need an OpenAI Platform account and a clear idea of the task or workflow you want your agent to perform. No coding is required for basic use.

# 6. How do I get started with Agent Builder?

**Answer:**

Log in to the OpenAI Platform, navigate to the Agent Builder, and click “Create New Agent Workflow.” From there, you can drag and connect nodes to design your agent.

# 7. What kind of tasks can I automate with AgentKit agents?

**Answer:**

You can automate tasks such as answering questions, summarizing documents, connecting to external APIs, routing logic, and more—depending on the models and tools you configure.

# 8. How do I deploy my AgentKit agent?

**Answer:**

You can deploy your agent using ChatKit (to embed in your product UI) or export the agent as Python or TypeScript code via the Agents SDK for custom integration.

# 9. Can I test my agent before deploying it?

**Answer:**

Yes. The Agent Builder provides a built-in testing interface to simulate agent runs, debug workflows, and ensure everything works as expected before deployment.

# 10. What should I do if my agent isn’t working as expected?

**Answer:**

Use the platform’s logs and debugging features to trace errors. Check node configurations, input/output connections, and utilize OpenAI’s optimization tools for troubleshooting.

# 11. Can I extend my agent with external knowledge or tools?

**Answer:**

Yes. You can add connectors for third-party tools, APIs, vector stores, and file search capabilities to enhance your agent’s knowledge and abilities.

# 12. Where can I find more tutorials and support?

**Answer:**

The official OpenAI documentation provides step-by-step guides, quickstart tutorials, and references. Visit [**the AgentKit documentation**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/agents/agent-builder) for more resources.

  
If you want to stay closer to the outcomes and apply agentic capabilities more directly to growth workflows, try [**Metaflow AI**](http://metaflow.life)",u_metaflow_ai,2025-10-07T21:55:13,Reddit

hi there,

I just started to learn programming (Python) and I came across this assignment in my coding class:

The fibonacci\_between(from, to) function returns a string with a list of Fibonacci sequence numbers but only from the open interval &lt;from, to) (similar to range). You cant use Lists, Booleans, Conditions . Only For loops and Range.

For example:

y = fibonacci\_between(0, 6)

y

'0 1 1 2 3 5 '

fibonacci\_between(10, 14)

'55 89 144 233 '

fibonacci\_between(100, 101)

'354224848179261915075 '

this is my code:

def fibonacci\_between(start, end):

result = """"

f1, f2 = 0, 1

for \_ in range(100):

result += str(f1) + "" ""

f1, f2 = f2, f1 + f2

result += "" "" \* ((f2 &gt;= start) \* 0) + str(f2) + "" ""

return result

But when I wanted to put this code up for testing, this came up:

Is the problem that I limited the code for only 100 fibbon. numbers? how should i fix it? If someone could help, I would be very thankfull.

Python,Otary now includes 17 image binarization methods,"**What does my project does**: Otary is an open-source Python library dedicated to image manipulation and 2D geometry processing. It gets even smarter with the addition of 17 binarization methods now available! [Jump to the documentation straight away](https://alexandrepoupeau.com/otary/api/image/transformers/thresholding/).

**Target Audience**: Python developers or researchers focused on image processing and computer vision tasks.

**Comparison**: you could actually use Numpy, OpenCV directly. They are used behind the scene by Otary.

Otary now includes 17 binarization methods, designed to make experimentation both simple for beginners and powerful for advanced users.

🔹 **5 basic methods**: easily accessible for quick and efficient use: simple, otsu, adaptive, bradley, and sauvola.

These methods are the most classic and effective, perfect for new users and for 90% of practical cases.

🔹 **12 advanced methods**: for users who want to explore, compare, and understand more sophisticated approaches.

They are intended for image processing specialists and researchers who want to experiment with new ideas.

📖 The documentation presents a summary table of the 17 methods, classified by year of publication and accompanied by links to the original scientific articles.

✨ My revelation: FAIR binarization.

FAIR stands for “Fast Algorithm for document Image Restoration” and it has completely changed the way I approach binarization. Rather than binarizing the entire image, it:

1. First detects edge pixels with a custom Canny edge detector
2. Applies a clustering algorithm to small windows centered around the edge pixels.
3. Performs post-processing to complete the total binarization of the image

This is the approach I found most innovative among all those I have explored and implemented. It uses the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to identify text pixels versus background pixels by assuming a Gaussian mixture distribution: it's simply brilliant!

💬 I sincerely hope that this update will make the work of developers, engineers, and researchers who manipulate images easier and inspire new explorations.

🙏 I would also like to encourage everyone to contribute, add new binarization methods, improve existing ones, or even invent new approaches.

If you spot an error or have ideas for improving Otary, your contributions are welcome, that's the spirit of open source.

Python,"Practical Guide to Fine-Tuning IBM Granite 4.0: Tips, Strategies &amp; Real-World Benchmarks","I've been working with IBM's Granite-4.0 model (3.2B parameters) and wanted to share a practical walkthrough on fine-tuning it for specific use cases. Many of us find that general-purpose LLMs don't always fit our exact workflows, so customization can be really valuable.



The approach I'm sharing uses Unsloth and Python to make fine-tuning more memory-efficient and faster—it even works on free Colab GPUs. The guide covers:



• Data preparation techniques

• Using LoRA adapters for parameter-efficient fine-tuning

• Complete code examples

• Deploying your fine-tuned model to Hugging Face



I wrote this with the goal of making the process accessible, even if you're relatively new to fine-tuning. The techniques can help reduce inference costs while improving performance for domain-specific tasks.



Full guide with code and benchmarks: [https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/ibms-granite-4-0-fine-tuning-made-simple-create-custom-ai-models-with-python-and-unsloth-4fc11b529c1f](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/ibms-granite-4-0-fine-tuning-made-simple-create-custom-ai-models-with-python-and-unsloth-4fc11b529c1f)

Go,My body feels completely out of my control,"I’ve always had a weird bladder, I couldn’t hold it and every so often I’d have to go so bad I can barely walk, and it’s painful.

This week it is completely unmanageable, and I don’t know what to do. I have to go every hour, and every single time it’s to the point I can barely walk, and I’m dripping on my way to the bathroom. Just last night, I woke up twice in bed sheets that were already wet, while I’m completely immobilized since I have to pee so bad. 

It’s never been this bad, I feel disgusted with myself and at a complete loss on how to manage this. I just wish my body would cooperate. I can’t even do my job. ",u_kanyeetus_the_fetus,2025-10-07T22:05:49,Reddit
Go,"Violence, self defense, and animals","I have a question about violence and self-defense. I really like the Parable of the Saw. I have also experienced extreme torture from others that were sentient and knowing, so I know how difficult it is to actually accomplish. I wish them well (and wish to minimize their negative kamma within my power through loving-kindness) but still get lost in feelings of anger or upsetness on occasion. If given an opportunity, I would have liked to avoid the experience to prevent them from carrying the weight of having done such things. Here's what troubles me.

I've heard stories of monks who, after being robbed and tortured by bandits, were left naked tied with living grass and refused to move, as their commitment to non-violence was so extreme that they refused to harm the grass (which the story extolls) or monks who make sure to carry a broom in front of them to not harm anything underfoot. I've also heard it said that animals suffer the repercussions of their killing and lack of practice of the dharma, trapping them within a cycle of victim and victimizer which prevents human rebirth. How far does this practice of non-violence go?

Modern science says that life exists in many, many tiny microbes and modern medicine is based on the killing of these beings. This is a killing of millions upon millions of living things, very often and with little regard to their lives, which is similar in motivation to how a person might kill an animal to eat meat in order to avoid the pain of hunger or death through starvation. In addition to this, to higher beings, our lives may have similar weight. Through that we can know how powerful that dispassionate disregard can feel. What is the most skillful way to avoid this?",Buddhism,2025-10-07T22:05:48,Reddit

Go,My (26F) boyfriend (27M) has hygiene issues and I’m losing attraction to him,"I don’t know what to do anymore. There are several aspects of the relationship that I feel like are blatantly failing, yet he doesn’t feel this way, and it creates such a disconnect between us. I can’t tell if I’m being greedy or not in wanting so many things to be improved. 

Things haven’t been easy. I became chronically ill during our time together, and now he has had to step into a caretaker role, which he did not sign up for. I can’t imagine how difficult that is. 

Although, I have been in an emotional caretaker role with him since day one. About a week into dating, he had a meltdown about packing his clothes for a trip and I had to pack them for him. He’s always been pretty unstable due to severe anxiety and ADHD, which he recently got on meds for, which have helped a little. 

Although, the issue is that usually when it comes to taking care of me, he handles things wonderfully and is the source of consistency I need when I am sick. He is good at providing. Otherwise, he falls short with most other things. 

Our relationship has consisted of me asking him to do the most basic of things, and him not doing them, like putting on deodorant every day. He’s only taken me on one date, the others we plan together. I see couples where the guy does cute surprise things all the time, which he never does for me aside from things I could not care less about, like these handmade cards he was making me for birthdays.etc. that I really didn’t like at all, which he probably knew deep down, given he admitted it was more of a project for him to do than a gift for me. The one time he got me flowers, he also admitted the color be picked out was more for him than for me, which honestly made me upset given it was my least favorite color out of them all, and I think he knew that. 

I’m autistic, and he’s constantly overstimulating me by thinking I’m saying things I don’t mean. I can say something as simple as, “let’s please make sure we get the laundry done today. I’ll do it if you don’t want to” and extremely exasperated, he’ll be like, “what do you mean?? Why did you say it like that?? I’m going to do it okay??” Like literally everything is an issue. We’ve been together for a year and a half, he knows by now how I speak, yet everything I say is still an issue. Yes, I also am direct, which is probably a mixture of the ASD and being from New York. That’s just how we talk up there (he’s from KY) 

He is the only partner I keep getting recurrent UTI’s with, and this is probably because he doesn’t clean himself properly. I just had a UTI so severe (I also have interstitial cystitis which is a chronic pain condition of the bladder) that we ended up in the ER. Why? Because he did not wash his hands before he fingered me, which I told him very clearly multiple times that he HAS to do. I’m honestly really struggling to not be mad at him, because it is technically his fault. The pain was so bad that two doses of morphine through the IV were not enough. And I don’t have insurance currently so that’s probably a 10k hospital bill, all because he couldn’t take what I said seriously enough and just wash his damn hands. When he ignores things that are so important for my health, it makes it hard to believe he truly cares about me the way he says that he does. 

He struggles greatly to take a shower every day. He also really struggles putting on deodorant to the point it’s hard for me to be around him. We just went to visit my mom and my little brother said my boyfriend smelt really bad. The issue is, my boyfriend doesn’t really care, as when I’ve talked to him about it before, he just says, “I don’t mind the smell” not considering how other people feel. You can see my recent post on my post history about his excessive farts from the protein bars. The next issue is he has really bad psoriasis on his head and face to the point it’s constantly all over him and gets all over anything near him, including me. It makes me feel dirty. His hairdresser recommended a shampoo, which he won’t get. He could have went to the doctor for a cream when he had insurance (he lost it recently) and he didn’t. It’s like he just has no concern for how his hygiene habits affect those around him. 

As mentioned, I have chronic illness, so my hygiene is not always up to par as much as I try, and when he’s dirty, which is all the time, it makes me feel even worse than I already do. 

He’s also gained twenty pounds recently and along with all the hygiene issues, I just find myself not being attracted to him anymore. And I hate that so much, because I’ve gained a massive amount of weight due to my illness since we’ve been together and he still reminds me how beautiful I am every single day. 

He still held my hand the entire time in the ER and stroked my hair and told me jokes. He still drove the entire way home (we were on a road trip) all by himself and made sure we got home despite how tired he was himself. 

He’s a great guy, and has a lot of great qualities, I just keep feeling this nagging feeling that I’m never going to truly be happy with him. We have a lot of incompatibilities, including hobbies, and the basic things like hygiene issues make those other incompatibilities harder to bear. 

I think I feel scared. As someone chronically ill that currently cannot work, I depend on him financially, and it pains me so much because Ive always been extremely independent before becoming completely disabled. I used to live alone. I loved it. I was single for five years. I was happy. If I could go back to that now, I would. But I can’t. 

I hate my life, I do. I hate where I live, with his 3 friends who are all crappy except for one of them in a bad and dangerous neighborhood.  People who don’t even want me living here (from the impression I get) but it’s my only option with my illness. I want a different life, but I don’t even know if I could have it with my illness. I don’t even know if I could find the person I’m looking for who would *also* be willing to take care of me. It’s a lot to ask, and I think I often use my illness as an excuse as to why he is how he is. That if he didn’t have the constant burden on him of my illness (emotional, financial, physical, etc.) he would have more energy to do the things I want, like plan cute dates for us to go on or buy my flowers from the farmers market (which I’ve asked him for very nicely more than 10x). I don’t know, I just see these other couples who like, don’t struggle to shower everyday, and I see their nice, normal, clean lives they live together in their nice, put together homes, and it makes me go, “I want that.” To the point I feel like I’m constantly longing for something I don’t have, despite the fact that many people are probably longing for the kind of love and devotion I have in my relationship. 

I feel constantly heartbroken and torn because I do love him so much, and he’s a great person who has done well by me, I just don’t think we are compatible. I felt we weren’t comparable since about week 1 of dating, and now, at a year and a half, that feeling hasn’t gone away. 


TL;DR: Boyfriend is a great person, but drives me nuts and constantly has bad hygiene which has sent me to the ER for infections multiple times ",relationships,2025-10-07T22:05:26,Reddit
Go,is it adhd or depression or what?,"i have absolutely zero motivation to do anything. i'm not exaggerating i will go weeks or even months without doing laundry or cleaning. it's not that i don’t care, it’s that it genuinely feels impossible. even small tasks like picking something up off the floor feel like i'm being asked to climb a mountain.

what is frustrating for me is that i don’t even notice it. i'll literally step over trash and not notice it’s there. it's like my brain just filters it out completely.

i've been this way for as long as i can remember, even when i was a child/teenager, and it’s getting to a point where i can't function like this anymore. i don’t really have hobbies, and even when i find something i like i just never follow through. it's like i can’t make myself want things, and definitely not enjoy them.

i had gotten diagnosed with adhd and i take adderall daily but it doesn't seem to really do much either except quiet my brain some.

i just want to understand why my brain works like this and if there’s a way to fix it???

Anyhow: since what he’s telling everyone is that he left because we wanted to live in different places, he had to sign off that I could leave the state with the kids (or be proven to be a liar). But he didn’t actually want me to leave. So he forced me to take the house in the agreement, thinking that that would prevent me from leaving. It won’t. I will be foreclosing on the house. When I do, it will hit both of our credit. I’m scared of what will happen when he finds out. He’s an incredibly violent person, I’m scared of him. I’m scared he will show up to my house with a gun.

Go,"Serious issue here, please help","Im convinced this game has some hidden mechanics that boost bad players or high ping players.

ONE example was from yesterday playing with a zamasu on my team. We were bottom lane, he ignored ALL farm on the way to mid, met up with the other team, and beat the shit out of them..... he then went on to get the classic three green card setup and proceeded to take near zero damage at all times and his green bar was always full (both green bars). He beat a trunks and vegeta down in seconds, no issues early game and late game.

I play zamasu next game because I questioned the fuck out of it and I was destroyed in a split second. So is the dude cheating (cant report players because bandai cares about feefees and upsetting people) or is there some hidden CoD level type of bullshit going on?

  
This is just one example. I understand how the characters work, but a good chunk of the time you see certain people pick the cliche card choices for a character then proceed to get some kind of extra boost that doesnt seem to happen when I choose the same cards. I get how cards work, I understand it lol I just dont get how the zamasu did what he did. Or how some Gohan stand in ssj3 gokus kame likes its nothing but when i try i get melted in a split second.

  
Love the game but this kind of inconsistent bs is making me hate the fuck out of it. Anyone else notice this? Is it cheating or can someone explain how it happens?",DragonBallSquadra,2025-10-07T22:05:11,Reddit

# What is OpenAI AgentKit and Agent Builder?

**AgentKit** is OpenAI’s modular toolkit for rapidly building, deploying, and optimizing agent workflows. At its core is the **Agent Builder**, a visual canvas that lets you create, connect, and orchestrate models, tools, logic, and knowledge sources—all without low-level coding.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Agent**: A system that intelligently accomplishes tasks, from simple goals to complex workflows.
* **Agent Builder**: A drag-and-drop GUI for designing agents, connecting models, tools, guardrails, and custom logic.
* **ChatKit**: Embeds your agent workflow in your product UI.
* **Agents SDK**: For exporting and running agents in Python or TypeScript.

# Prerequisites: What You Need Before You Build

* **OpenAI Platform Account**: Sign up or log in at [**OpenAI Platform**](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
* **Familiarity With Task Goals**: Have a clear idea of the workflow or task your agent should accomplish (e.g., answering questions, summarizing documents).
* **No Coding Required**: AgentKit’s Agent Builder is visual and accessible to non-coders, but basic logic and API concepts help.

# Step-by-Step: Build Your First AgentKit Agent

# Step 1: Access the Agent Builder

* Go to the OpenAI Platform dashboard.

JavaScript,"Super Fun Project for Beginners to Contribute to: Aesthetic, Open-source Platform for Learning Japanese inspired by Monkeytype","The idea is actually quite simple. As a Japanese learner and a JavaScript coder, I've always wanted there to be an open-source, 100% free platform for learning Japanese, similar to Monkeytype in the typing community.

What makes it unique is that there are a dozen different color themes and fonts that allow for extended customizability and easy PR opportunities for beginners. You can simply add your own theme by tweaking a couple color values and start contributing to an active open-source project with more than 300 stars on GitHub and 5K monthly active users.

Why? Because weebs and otakus deserve to have a free, community-driven, high-quality platform for learning Japanese too. And beginners deserve a simple, fun project that can hone their dev and open-source skills.

JavaScript,Export Diarly to Obsidian - vibe coding inspiration and thank you to the community,"I've been using both Diarly and Obsidian for a while, and though I love both, it was time to bring everything under one roof because I want to be able to interlink them more easily.

While there are a lot of plugins and/or advice on the most popular import/export paths (from Bear, Evernote, DayOne, etc) I couldn't find one for the Diarly app... except for this python script that was vibe-coded by GitHib user sussdorff. 

A few things:

1. **THANK YOU sussdorff** \- this is why I love the Obsidian community 
2. I have been looking into vibe coding, and this pushed me over the edge. I especially loved the ""JOURNEY"" file linked above, which explained how you prompted and refined your way to victory. Not only did you provide a valuable tool, you also helped me understand how to approach it on my own a bit... so now I am going to go try to vibe code my first idea: I use my Apple Pencil a ton to Scribble on my iPad, and when I am writing in Obsidian (and other apps). I desperately want a virtual ""Delete"" button to delete the last character I wrote; it's really hard to use Scribble strokes to delete just one character. So I'll make a JavaScript or RegEx snippet and add it as a custom button to one of the Toolbar plugins I use... I just have no idea how to code this... YET!

Anyway, this is mostly just an appreciation post for this community ❤️",ObsidianMD,2025-10-07T20:57:17,Reddit

JavaScript,Need Help: Bypassing Delayed Content Filter for Time-Sensitive Data on a B2B Marketplace (Advanced Session/Cookie Issue),"Hello everyone,

I'm facing a frustrating and complex issue trying to monitor a major B2B marketplace for time-sensitive RFQs (Request For Quotations). I need instant notifications, but the platform is aggressively filtering access based on session status.



# 🎯 The Core Problem: Paid Access vs. Bot Access



The RFQs I need are posted to the site instantly. However, the system presents two completely different versions of the RFQ page:

1. **Authenticated (Manual View):** When I log in **manually** with my paid seller account, I see the new RFQs **immediately**.
2. **Unauthenticated (Bot View):** When a monitoring tool (or any automated script) accesses the exact same RFQ page URL, the content is treated as public. Consequently, the time-sensitive RFQs are intentionally **delayed by exactly one hour** in the captured content.

The immediate visibility is tied directly to the **paid, logged-in session cookie**.



# ⚙️ What We've Tried (And Why It Failed)



We have failed to inject the necessary authenticated session state because of the platform's security measures:

* **Visual Login Automation:** Fails because the site forces **2FA (SMS Verification)** immediately for any new automated browser session. We cannot bypass the SMS code prompt.
* **Cookie Injection via Request Headers:** Fails because the monitoring tool throws errors when trying to ingest the extremely long, complex cookie string we extract from our live session.
* **JavaScript Injection of Cookies:** Fails, likely due to special characters within the long cookie string breaking the JavaScript syntax.
* **Internal Email Alerts:** Fails, as the platform's own email notification system is also delayed by the same one hour.



# 🙏 Seeking Novel Solutions



The authentication cookie is the key we cannot deliver reliably. Since we cannot inject the cookie or successfully generate it via automated login/2FA, are there any **out-of-the-box or extremely niche techniques** for this scenario?

**Specific Ideas We're Looking For (The ""Hacks""):**

* **Session Token Conversion:** Is there a reliable way to get a stable Python script to output a single, simple, URL-encoded **session token** that's easier for the monitor to inject than the raw, complex cookie string?
* **Minimalist Cookie List:** Are there known industry-standard methods to identify *only* the 2-3 essential session cookies from a long list to bypass injection limits?
* **Local File Bridge Validation:** Is anyone experienced in setting up a local network bridge where a working automation script (Selenium) saves the HTML/data to a local file, and a second monitoring tool simply watches that local file for changes? (Seeking pitfalls/best practices for this method.)

Any creative thoughts or experience with bypassing these specific types of delayed content filters would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",learnprogramming,2025-10-07T20:05:41,Reddit

JavaScript,Conseils pour réussir à décrocher un job - Entretiens qui ne donnent rien.,"Bonjour,  
  
Je suis en recherche d’un emploi d’ingénieur logiciel / développeur full stack Java/Angular depuis 03/2025. Je suis basé en Isère (38) et je candidate surtout pour des offres aux alentours (Surtout périmètre lyonnais). Je candidate avec ce CV (voir ci-joint) sur les sites tel que hellowork, France Travail ou free-work depuis cette date (03/2025). J’ai fait une dizaine voire quinzaine d’entretien et aucun n’a donné lieu à une proposition de CDI. Je me suis diplômé dans la Biologie en 2020 et j’ai fais une reconversion en 2022 vers du développement full stack. En 2022 j’ai intégré une ESN (Capgemini) avec un CDI qui s’est rompu en février dernier suite a des problèmes de santé (J’ai une maladie mentale) et des agissement qui ont conduit a un licenciement pour faute grave.

Je poste ici pour avoir des conseils et des avis sur ce qui pourrait empêcher mon recrutement.

Dans chaque entretien je commence à me présenter et je parle de ma reconversion et de mon fond de biologiste. A la question de savoir pourquoi je ne travaille plus à mon ancien poste j’ai fait plusieurs réponse, au début des fois je dis c’est a cause du salaire qui ne bouge pas, des fois je dis que je voulais voir ailleurs et récemment j’ai commencé à dire que j’avais des problèmes de santé qui ont conduit a une rupture de contrat.

Je parle des deux missions auxquelles j’ai participé chez Capgemini et je fais l’accent sur la mission build chez le client Iveco.

Je voulais aussi poser une question sur le trou dans le cv durant cette période et s’il pourrait jouer contre une éventuelle embauche.

Unfortunately, I am unable to offer my services for free as I have ***financial obligations to meet***. The compensation I am requesting is both fair and necessary.

&gt;***As a freelancer, I do not receive health insurance or similar benefits; my earnings are directly tied to my workload/output. Please consider this before offering a lower compensation, or realistically assess whether your budget can support the project you envision.***

I am more than willing to go the extra mile for projects or clients that offer a rewarding experience, especially for those projects in which I have a high level of interest.

Intelligent beings use DMs for direct communication (in my case, via my public email address). I don't engage in public. Stay discreet.

Java,"I just got an ""IT specialist"" job despite having really no qualifications whatsoever. Very excited but very, very shocked.","So I recently moved back in my family (living in Poland, used to live in Warsaw) because I will be starting university next year.   
On the job hunt I saw a posting for an ""IT specialist"" thinking it's really just mostly a help desk position.   
I know computers in terms of hardware and Windows/Linus well enough.   
But the only real experience I have with programming is getting about 60% through The Odin Project and taking a Java course from the University of Helsinki. And I've done a few projects from the Arduino starter kit. 

On my CV that's all I had. I didn't put that I worked in an IT position before so I kinda went to the interview as a ""eh, wtf, why not"". Not really expecting to get a call back.   
But here I am. 

I find one of their postings for the position on a different job portal and they put that they are looking for someone who is familiar with the following:

* SQL
* PowerShell
* Excel
* Active Directory
* Linux
* Windows Server
* Microsoft Power BI
* Android / Raspberry PI

What the hell should I expect from this position and is there some way I can prepare to be better equipped?  
I would actually really love to hold on to this job as a foot in the door for the tech industry in the future. 

Thanks!",ITCareerQuestions,2025-10-07T21:51:41,Reddit

Java,Simplify JavaFX Application Building and Distribution,"Hi,

I recently released a [JavaFX plugin](https://github.com/jeka-dev/javafx-plugin) for [JeKa](https://jeka.dev) to simplify the process of building JavaFX applications into runnable, downloadable distributions. Compared to Maven or traditional tools, this solution eliminates several pain points:

* No need of XML build configuration.
* No need to install a new JDK when switching between JDK versions.
* No need to install a new JavaFX kit when switching between versions.
* No need to package the application into JAR, .exe, .dmg, or other formats.
* No need to store binaries in a public repository.
* Users don’t need to have the required JDK or JavaFX libraries installed.

All you need is a Git repository!

Check out a port of dev-tools using Jeka, a JavaFX application originally built with Maven: [https://github.com/djeang/devtools](https://github.com/djeang/devtools)",JavaFX,2025-10-07T21:42:43,Reddit

Margarita Bautista Dy of Ayala Land Inc. (#69), Lynette V. Ortiz of Land Bank of the Philippines (#72), Lourdes Gutierrez-Alfonso of Megaworld Corporation (#92), and Ana Maria Aboitiz Delgado of Union Bank of the Philippines (#94).Sazon also led a total of seven Filipinas who made it to last year’s list, together with Dy, Ortiz, and Alfonso.“This year’s Most Powerful Women Asia recognizes 100 leaders who are leveraging regional and global volatility for business advantage,” Fortune Magazine said.Chosen by Fortune editors for their measurable impact, strategic reach, and capacity to shape the future, MPW Asia 2025 features founders, CEOs, and other C-suite leaders of large companies, regional champions, and high-growth ventures whose influence extends across borders and industries.More than a third of MPW Asia finalists are leaders within Global 500, China 500, and Southeast Asia 500 companies. The ranking spans 14 markets in Southeast Asia, Greater China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Australia.“Selection is editorial and data-driven. We draw on public filings, company disclosures, independent reporting, and nominations—both internal and external,” the magazine said.It added that, “As in prior years, our evaluation emphasizes company scale and health, career momentum, influence, innovation, and contributions to social impact; final placement reflects both current clout and future trajectory.”Fortune’s editors scored each MPW Asia candidate on scale and performance of the business the person leads, using mid-term and recent (12-month) indicators such as revenue and profit growth, profitability, and market value.Other criteria included innovation, if she executed original moves that competitors later followed; influence, if her decisions shape markets, agendas, or institutions beyond her remit; trajectory, where she is on the arc of her career; and impact, if she is using her power to drive broader positive change.“We thank Fortune Magazine for naming Megaworld President and CEO Lourdes Gutierrez-Alfonso as one of the 100 ‘Most Powerful Women in Asia’ once again this year,” said Megaworld.It added that, “Alongside female leaders in various fields across Asia, we celebrate the power of women who drive excellence, innovation, and inspiration, not just in their respective fields but also in the communities and organizations they serve.“We salute our leader and all these women across Asia for their exemplary achievements that are worth emulating.”",mb,2025-10-07T04:41:00,NewsData

now all we can do is watch character ai deal with this behind the scenes.and just guess what they will do. I speculate they are just gonna act like they are already fixing a problem and just ignore the 2 lawsuits. 
They are only acting like they care about the loud minority.They already did get rid of minors on the app by nerfing everything for them.this is how companies act and they're catering to right audience.

C++,"Need help choosing the best 10.1""–15.6"" portable display for Jetson Nano Orin Super (HDMI A compatible)","Hey everyone,

I’m trying to pick a **portable display (10.1""–15.6"")** that works reliably with my **Jetson Nano Orin Super** running **Ubuntu 24.04**, and I could really use some community advice.

Right now, I’m looking at these two options from Waveshare:

1. [**Waveshare 13.3"" Capacitive Touch Screen LCD with Case (1920×1080, HDMI, IPS)**](https://robu.in/product/waveshare-13-3inch-capacitive-touch-screen-lcd-with-case-1920x1080-hdmi-ips/)  
2. [**Waveshare 10.1"" Capacitive Touch Display (1280×800, Wide Color Gamut, Optical Bonding, HDMI/Type-C)**](https://robu.in/product/waveshare-10-1inch-capacitive-touch-display-wide-color-gamut-1280x800-optical-bonding-toughened-glass-panel-hdmi-type-c-display-interface/)

I like Waveshare’s build quality, but before finalizing, I wanted to ask:

* Is there **anything better** in the 10.1""–15.6"" range (preferably **Full HD** or higher, good brightness, and touch support)?
* I’d prefer one that has a **full-size HDMI A port** instead of mini HDMI (most portable displays only offer mini).
* I already have a **DisplayPort-to-HDMI converter cable** and a regular HDMI cable.
* Ideally, it should be **USB-C powered** or easy to power from the Jetson setup.

Would love to hear your recommendations or personal experiences — especially with displays that **just work plug-and-play** with Jetson boards.  
Also, how’s your experience with **touchscreen calibration** on Ubuntu 24.04?

C++,9-bar OPV spring mod for GCP,"Opened up my Gaggia and replaced the stock OPV spring (12/15 bar) with a 9 bar spring that I got from SoC. The process was pretty straight forward, however, it did require a lot of self talk and borrowed guts. Figurative borrowed guts. Had the opportunity to pull just one shot after the replacement and I’m told that either the machine was too hot or the beans haven’t rested so will post a long term review later. The shot tasted much smoother than the stock spring. Added soda. Looking for a good pressure sensor domestically available to take this testing a notch further. Recommendations welcome!",IndiaCoffee,2025-10-07T22:09:00,Reddit

C++,"AutoSave in Word/OneDrive has stopped saving to Computer by default, creating a brand new file every time. How do I fix this?","My company uses both SharePoint and OneDrive, but I've been able to autosave Word documents in the past with no issues. Lately, though, AutoSave keeps toggling itself off. When I click it to On, it makes me log into OneDrive every time, then turns itself on again. When I do this, it saves a brand new copy in a generic OneDrive Documents folder. My IT team has been unable to help.

  
Here are my current Save settings. The issue persists no matter whether the ""AutoSave files stored in the Cloud"" ticked or unticked. I try to delete the default local file location section or change it, and it just adds itself back all over again.

C++,Everything You Need to Know: CBS Takeover by Pro-Israel Billionaires,"🚨 CBS News is being taken over by pro-Israel billionaires.

David Ellison, son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, has bought Paramount and is putting Bari Weiss — a self-described “Zionist fanatic” — in charge of CBS News.

This is not journalism. It is corporate propaganda to whitewash Israel’s crimes in Gaza.
