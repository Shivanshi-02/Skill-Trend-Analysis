Technology,Python,Help Build Open Source Nepal: Contribute to Projects That Matter!🇳🇵,"Hey r/TechNepal! 👋

We're on a mission to build **Open Source Nepal**, a community-driven project to create **efficient, transparent, and powerful solutions** similar to the ones the government should be building but better. With the power of **TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Django**, **Next.js and React Native** we want to make a real difference, and we need **your skills** to make it happen.

# 🚀 What We’re Building:

We’re developing a platform using:

* **Django** for the backend, creating scalable APIs.
* **Next.js** for the frontend, delivering lightning-fast user experiences.
* **React Native** for the mobile app, offering seamless access across devices.

# 👩‍💻 How You Can Contribute:

* **Backend (Django)**: Help scale and improve API services.
* **Frontend (Next.js)**: Build new features, enhance UI/UX, and optimize performance.
* **Mobile (React Native)**: Create and maintain a user-friendly mobile app.
* **Documentation**: Help write clear, useful guides for future contributors.
* **Code Reviews &amp; Mentoring**: Support and guide new developers who join the project.

# 🌱 Why Contribute?

In a time when **Gen Z** is raising their voices against corruption and inefficiency in government systems, we’re working to build **open-source projects that are more efficient, transparent, and accessible**.

By contributing to **Open Source Nepal**, you’re:

* **Building government-like projects** but making them **better**. We’re focusing on **efficiency**, **security**, and **user-centric designs**—something the government often lacks.
* **Challenging the status quo**: Instead of waiting for change, we’re creating it ourselves. Maybe, just maybe, the **government will adopt** some of these open-source solutions down the road.
* **Empowering the Nepali tech community** by creating projects that can be used for the public good—whether it’s for elections, civic engagement, or improving government services.
* **Fighting corruption with transparency**: Our goal is to build software that can **serve the people**, not just be controlled by a few. Every line of code you contribute brings us one step closer to a more accountable system.

You’ll be making an impact **now and for the future**, not just on a personal level, but on the national scale!

# 🛠️ Get Involved:

Join our  **Discord server** : [https://discord.gg/GQGFKDAQ9b](https://discord.gg/GQGFKDAQ9b)  
and Check out our **Github Repos**: [https://github.com/orgs/osnepal/repositories](https://github.com/orgs/osnepal/repositories)  and dive into open tasks. If you’re not sure where to start, drop a message in the server or DM me, and We’ll guide you.

Together, we can build something truly impactful—let’s start with the tech that the **government should’ve built**! 💪

Looking forward to your contributions!",technepal,2025-09-22T21:41:41,https://reddit.com/r/technepal/comments/1nnqrby/help_build_open_source_nepal_contribute_to/,Reddit
Technology,Python,BA here looking for advice.,"Hi Reddit - I'm a business analyst.

Because of some changes around at my business, I'm now helping out the dev team, something I've not got much experience in. The team mostly work in Java (with a little PostgreSQL and Python in the mix, and a rare bit of PHP and other misc).

I'd like some recommendations for some reading or a casual boot camp I could do in my spare time to upskill a bit. I'm not looking to actually become a dev, but I'd like to be able to understand the systems a bit better, require fewer technical explanations from the devs, and generally be a bit more use to the (very patient and lovely) devs I'm now working with.

Technology,Python,"How to disable the ""file could harm your device"" warning in Edge","Hello,

I'm trying to get rid of the ""could harm your device"" warning that keeps appearing when I download files (like Python scripts) in Microsoft Edge. It's very frustrating to have to click ""Keep"" every single time.

https://preview.redd.it/80c8euekpqqf1.png?width=450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d60f953393ee9d2ec9eda3fda8175642910491c

This is on my personal Windows 11 PC, so no company policies are involved.

Here is what I've already tried without success:

* In Edge Settings, `Protect from harmful sites and downloads (SmartScreen)` it is **turned off**.
* In Windows Security (`App &amp; browser control` \-&gt; `Reputation-based protection`Both `SmartScreen for Microsoft Edge` and `Potentially unwanted app blocking` are **turned off**.
* Despite being off, the settings for PUA blocking are greyed out, stating that SmartScreen needs to be on to enable it. This seems contradictory.

I'm attaching screenshots of my settings and the download warning. Can anyone please help me figure out how to permanently disable this?

Thanks in advance!

Technology,Python,"How do you design clean, scalable DB interactions in Python/Django projects","Hey everyone,

I’ve been working on projects where the **database layer** is the real backbone, and I’m trying to improve how I design and interact with it in Python/Django projects (not strictly tied to Django REST Framework).

I’m aware of things like the **singleton pattern** for certain use cases (also one of those interview-favorite topics), but I feel like there’s a lot more to keep in mind when it comes to **code + database best practices**.

I’d love your input on:

I got the idea of maybe combining some lightweight LLM model with PubMed and well this is what I got!


This app (I don't have a name for it yet) lets. you create folders/collections, and add pubmed abstracts (with URL to the actual article) and includes a built in collection viewer where you can easily summarize selected articles or talk to the LLM that has some degree of awareness on what you're reading


It's pretty cool that the entire thing was built using only Python. The back end and the LLM itself (gemini flash model) was easily created using just python; also the front end completely in Python as well


\### Target Audience

All python devs I guess or anyone interested in creating full stack apps in a single stack language. I probably would not have built it if I had to go and pick up some JS + HTML just to create the front end!

Technology,Python,"Jeff Clune: Open-Ended, Quality Diversity, and AI-Generating Algos in the Era of Foundation Models","# NotebookLM Briefing: 

# Executive Summary

This document synthesizes the core arguments and evidence presented by Jeff Clune on a new paradigm for developing advanced Artificial Intelligence. The central thesis posits that direct, goal-focused optimization is ineffective for solving truly ambitious problems. Instead, progress is achieved through algorithms that embrace open-ended exploration, collect a diverse array of high-quality ""stepping stones,"" and generate new challenges as they solve existing ones.

Three classes of algorithms form the foundation of this approach:

1. **Quality Diversity (QD) Algorithms:** These methods, exemplified by MAP-Elites, aim to discover a wide variety of high-performing solutions rather than a single optimum. By creating an ""archive of elites,"" they enable serendipitous discovery and provide multiple pathways for innovation, a process termed ""goal switching.""
2. **Open-Ended Algorithms:** Inspired by Darwinian evolution and human culture, these algorithms are designed to innovate endlessly and forever. The key mechanism, demonstrated by the POET algorithm, is the ability to generate increasingly complex and diverse learning environments, thereby creating its own curriculum of challenges.
3. **AI-Generating Algorithms (AIGAs):** This overarching philosophy proposes that the most effective path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is not to hand-design it, but to create systems that search for it. This involves replacing hand-crafted components (architectures, learning algorithms, environments) with automated, learned pipelines.

The advent of foundation models has dramatically accelerated this research agenda. Large Language Models (LLMs) can now serve as a ""model of human notions of interestingness"" (Omni), guiding open-ended search toward novel and meaningful problems. They can also programmatically generate the environments themselves, creating theoretically infinite, or ""Darwin-complete,"" search spaces (Omni-EPIC). Concurrently, foundation world models like Genie provide a second path to Darwin-completeness by acting as fully neural, generative simulators. Finally, pre-training agents on vast video datasets (VPT, SIMA) overcomes the sample inefficiency of reinforcement learning, a key bottleneck for open-ended systems.

This combined ""playbook"" of open-endedness plus foundation models is proving to be exceptionally powerful, with successful applications in automatically designing agentic systems (ADOS), creating self-improving AI (Darwin Gödel Machine), automating the entire scientific discovery process (The AI Scientist), and enhancing AI safety through automated capability discovery (ACD).

# 1. The Paradox of Direct Optimization

The central premise is that direct, relentless optimization toward a specific, ambitious goal often leads to failure. This paradox is illustrated by several examples:

* **The Maze Metaphor:** An agent rewarded only for moving closer to a goal will get stuck against a wall, whereas an agent rewarded for simply exploring new places will trivially solve the maze.
* **Historical Innovation:** To invent the microwave, one needed to work on radar technology and notice a melted chocolate bar—a discovery impossible if the sole objective was ""more cooking per minute with less smoke."" Similarly, the modern computer required the invention of electricity and vacuum tubes, technologies not developed for computation.

The conjecture is that ""the only way to solve really hard problems may be by creating the problems while you solve them and then goal switching between them."" This requires algorithms that can:

* **Capture Serendipitous Discoveries:** Recognize and pursue interesting, unexpected behaviors even if they do not immediately improve performance on the primary objective.
* **Engage in Goal Switching:** Add new, interesting skills or states to the set of objectives, treating them as potential ""stepping stones"" toward more complex goals.

# 2. Quality Diversity (QD) Algorithms: The Archive of Stepping Stones

Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms are designed to produce not a single best solution, but a ""huge diversity of high quality solutions,"" much like Darwinian evolution produced a vast array of well-adapted organisms.

# 2.1. MAP-Elites: The Poster Child Algorithm

MAP-Elites is the most popular QD algorithm. Its process is as follows:

1. **Define Dimensions:** The user specifies dimensions of variation they care about (e.g., a robot's height and weight) and a performance measure (e.g., speed). These dimensions form a grid or ""map.""
2. **Evaluate and Archive:** An agent (parameterized by a vector `theta`) is generated and evaluated for its performance and its properties (its coordinates on the map). It is then placed in the corresponding cell of the archive.
3. **Iterate and Improve:** The algorithm loops continuously:
   * Select an ""elite"" from the archive.
   * Perturb it slightly to create a new agent.
   * Evaluate the new agent.
   * If the new agent has higher performance than the existing elite in its corresponding map cell, it replaces that elite. Otherwise, it is discarded. This process grows a comprehensive archive of the best-known solution for each combination of traits.

# 2.2. Key Applications and Evidence

* **Soft Robotics:**
   * **Classic Optimization:** Produced poor-performing solutions and explored very little of the search space.
   * **Multi-Objective Optimization (Rewarding Diversity):** Achieved higher performance but still explored the space poorly.
   * **MAP-Elites:** With the same compute, it produced a ""complete revolution in what is possible,"" fully exploring the space and revealing its structure, including local optima. Analysis of the solution lineages shows they follow long, circuitous paths through the search space, validating the importance of goal switching.
* **Rapid Robot Adaptation (Nature, 2015):** A QD algorithm was used to generate a large archive of diverse, high-quality gaits for a robot in simulation. When the real robot was damaged, it could quickly search this archive (using Bayesian optimization) to find a compensatory gait within 1-2 minutes.
* **Go-Explore (Nature, 2021):** This QD-inspired algorithm tackled hard-exploration reinforcement learning problems where rewards are sparse. By seeking to visit a diversity of states in the highest-scoring way possible, Go-Explore ""blew the roof off"" the Atari benchmark suite.
   * It achieved arbitrarily high scores on *Montezuma's Revenge*, a grand challenge for the field, surpassing the human world record.
   * It achieved state-of-the-art or human-level performance on all hard exploration games in the suite, effectively solving the benchmark.
   * It also solved difficult robotics tasks where other state-of-the-art methods failed completely.

# 3. Open-Ended Algorithms: The Quest for Endless Innovation

While QD algorithms are powerful, they are typically ""stuck in one single environment."" The goal of open-ended algorithms is to create systems that ""truly endlessly innovate forever,"" akin to the 3.5 billion years of Darwinian evolution or the ever-expanding sphere of human culture and science.

# 3.1. The Key Ingredient: Creating New Problems

A critical component of open-endedness is that the solution to one problem creates new problems and learning opportunities. For example, the evolution of tall trees (a solution for getting sunlight) created a new niche for giraffes and caterpillars. The goal is to build algorithms that operate on this principle.

# 3.2. POET: Endlessly Generating Environments

The Paired Open-ended Trailblazer (POET) algorithm was a major step in this direction.

* **Mechanism:** POET searches for both agents (solutions) and environments (problems) simultaneously. It maintains an archive of environmental stepping stones. Periodically, it mutates an existing environment and adds the new version to the archive if it is novel and presents a learnable challenge (not too easy, not too hard) for the current agents.
* **Results:**
   * The system autonomously generated its own curriculum, starting with simple obstacles (stumps, gaps) and progressively combining them into highly complex terrains.
   * ""Replaying the tape of life"" experiments showed that agents could *not* solve the complex final environments via direct training. They required the ""weird counterintuitive curricula"" generated by the open-ended process.
   * One run of an enhanced POET could produce an ""explosion of diversity"" in both environments and the agents that solve them, creating deep phylogenetic branches of distinct environmental themes.

# 4. The AI-Generating Algorithms (AIGA) Philosophy

Zooming out, the AIGA philosophy proposes an alternative path to AGI based on a clear historical trend in machine learning: ""handdesigned pipelines get replaced by entirely learned pipelines as we have more compute and more data."" Rather than hand-crafting AGI, the goal is to create algorithms that search for it.

This requires progress on three fundamental pillars:

1. **Metalearning Architectures:** Automatically discovering novel neural network architectures (e.g., via Neural Architecture Search). It is predicted that a learned architecture will eventually surpass the Transformer.
2. **Metalearning Learning Algorithms:** Automatically discovering new optimization and learning methods.
3. **Automatically Generating Learning Environments:** This is the domain of open-ended algorithms like POET.

# 5. The Transformative Impact of Foundation Models

Foundation models have unlocked solutions to long-standing challenges in open-endedness, creating a powerful, general-purpose ""playbook.""

# 5.1. Omni: Solving the ""Interestingness"" Problem

A grand challenge in open-endedness has been quantifying what is ""interestingly new."" Hand-coded objectives often lead to pathological behaviors (e.g., an agent staring at TV static because it's always novel).

* **The Insight:** While humans struggle to define ""interesting,"" we ""know it when we see it."" The breakthrough is that ""language models also know it when they see it,"" having distilled human notions of what is interesting versus boring from the entire internet.
* **The Omni Algorithm:** Guides open-ended search by asking a foundation model to judge whether a proposed new environment is an ""interestingly new problem to solve"" given the archive of environments the agent has already mastered.
* **Results:** In complex domains like Crafter and an ""infinite task space"" kitchen environment, Omni successfully generated meaningful curricula and systematically made progress, whereas methods based on uniform sampling or simple learning progress failed.

# 5.2. Darwin-Complete Search Spaces

A key goal is to operate in a search space that can ""express any conceivable... or more technically any computable environment."" Two such ""Darwin-complete"" search spaces have been realized with foundation models.

* **Omni-EPIC (Environments Programmed in Code):** This system uses Omni to have an LLM *write the code* for new environments and reward functions. Since the programming language is Turing-complete, the search space is theoretically infinite. In one run, it generated a wide diversity of tasks, from crossing moving platforms to clearing dishes in a cluttered restaurant.
* **Genie (Generative Interactive Environments):** This approach realizes a previously futuristic idea: the neural network itself acts as the entire world simulator.
   * **Mechanism:** Genie is a foundation world model that takes a single image and an action as input and generates the next image/observation.
   * **Progress:** The technology has advanced at a staggering rate. Early versions produced fuzzy, 2-second clips of 2D platformers. Within roughly a year, subsequent versions could generate high-resolution, interactive 3D worlds, allowing a user to fly a helicopter, drive a jet ski, or run across a rainbow bridge. As Clune states, ""This is the worst it will ever be.""

# 5.3. VPT &amp; SIMA: Accelerating Learning with Pre-training

A major bottleneck for open-ended systems is the computational inefficiency of reinforcement learning. The solution is to leverage the ""GPT playbook"" by pre-training on large human datasets.

* **VPT (Video Pre-Training):**
   * **Problem:** To learn from online videos (e.g., of Minecraft gameplay), the agent needs to know what actions the human player took, which are not typically recorded.
   * **Solution:** An ""inverse dynamics model"" was trained on a small labeled dataset to infer actions from video frames. This model was then used to label 70,000 hours of online Minecraft videos, creating a massive dataset for pre-training.
   * **Results:** The pre-trained agent learned complex skills zero-shot and exhibited intelligent exploration behavior. With fine-tuning, it solved the difficult ""diamond pickaxe"" challenge in Minecraft, a task that takes skilled humans 20 minutes and was impossible for agents trained from scratch.
* **SIMA:** This project extends the pre-training concept across multiple complex video games. The resulting agent can transfer its skills to a completely new game nearly as effectively as an agent trained specifically on that game from the start.

# 6. The AIGA Playbook in Action: Modern Applications

The combination of open-endedness, QD principles, and foundation models forms a powerful and generalizable playbook.

# 7. AI Safety Considerations

Throughout the research, AI safety is highlighted as a first-class citizen. Open-ended and self-improving systems present unique risks because they are designed to be creative and surprising. Best practices employed in this work include:

* Operating systems in contained, monitored environments.
* Maintaining human oversight.
* Advocating for injecting values into systems to prevent them from exploring dangerous or unethical directions.
* Promoting transparency through watermarking and clear disclosure of AI-generated content in publications.",singularity,2025-09-22T21:23:50,https://reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1nnq9zf/jeff_clune_openended_quality_diversity_and/,Reddit
Technology,Python,DirectLake + Polars,"I've realized that for my workload, using Python notebooks with just Polars offers tremendous time savings (don't have to spin up Spark, etc.). And my largest table is about 2MM rows. 

My question is as follows (and I have yet to test this) - I know that DirectLake is fast because it uses VORDER, etc. on Delta Tables. However, with Polars, there are a few modifications that have to be made at even the ""CREATE TABLE"" point (deletion vectors have to be off for example). And Polar's writer (if I'm not mistaken) doesn't use VORDER to write. 

What's are the best practices for having the same super-efficient delta tables (DirectLake optimized) as if one was using Spark, but without using it for most write operations?

**OPEN vs the AMC/GME Playbook – Same Game, New Ticker**

Back in the AMC/GME era, the “experts” told us:

* *No fundamentals*
* *Retail is stupid*
* *Just a meme stock*

Meanwhile, brokers were halting buys, sell buttons disappeared (remember Robinhood?), and the media was running nonstop hit pieces. That wasn’t “fundamentals” — that was market makers &amp; institutions protecting themselves while retail exposed the cracks.

Now look at $OPEN.

* Every spike? Walked back down.
* Every bullish print? Drowned out with “no fundamentals” headlines.
* Retail sentiment? Attacked, mocked, called dumb money.

But here’s the thing:  
📈 Volume doesn’t lie (100M+ before lunch).  
💥 MMs can only suppress the coil so long.  
🔥 Retail stepping in punishes shorts, saves a company, and builds profit.

This is a rigged system, yes — but it only works if we let them control the narrative. The tape *always* has to release, or they risk blowing up completely.

History doesn’t repeat, but it rhymes. AMC/GME showed us the blueprint. Now it’s OPEN’s turn.",u_Xfire2319,2025-09-22T21:40:10,https://reddit.com/r/u_Xfire2319/comments/1nnqpwy/open_vs_the_amcgme_playbook_same_game_new_ticker/,Reddit

Finance,Stock Market,"Shanzhai ""HTC EVO HD"": Neither a Genuine HTC Nor a Genuine Verizon","As mentioned in the title, this is not a genuine HTC but a Chinese Shanzhai phone.

Its name and appearance are combination of HTC EVO 4G, EVO 3D and Desire HD. But it has a rather weaker performance. Its CPU is only Qualcomm MSM7627A 800MHz ARM11, even hardly to be considered as a member of Snapdragon family. So its scores in performance test is unworthy of mentioning.

The phone’s actual Android version is 2.2.2, but it was falsely labeled as 2.3.9 (a version number that doesn’t exist). In reality, its software compatibility only reaches Android 2.2. Moreover, it uses the stock Android UI without any port or imitation of HTC Sense.

Though marked with a logo of Verizon Wireless (but EVO series is originally from Sprint, not Verizon), it's actually not a US-spec handset. It's still a CDMA/GSM dual-mode dual standby handset in Chinese style, with two phone card slots. It supports CDMA2000 1X EV-DO 3G, but UMTS (WCDMA) is not supported because its GSM baseband is NXP5209, a chipset with only EDGE support. While the genuine Verizon ""global"" phone, for example my genuine HTC Touch Pro 2 XV6875 even released earlier, is equipped with only one card slot (because USDM CDMA is used with programmed numbers rather than RUIM cards), but with global support of CDMA/GSM/WCDMA(in China it also supports CDMA UIM card). But it's a pity that there's no 2G signal around me now, neither GSM nor CDMA. Just 3G WCDMA is still alive. 

This phone’s language options covered most of the world’s major languages. It also came with Google Search integration, which by then was already somewhat out of step with the situation in the domestic Chinese market. But outside of China, where else would it have been appreciated? Considering that it required the card-and-device–separated CDMA2000 EV-DO system, perhaps in Ukraine, Indonesia… or somewhere else?

More foreigners are investing in our market making it volatile and liquid which is beneficial at the end of day to retailers like me and you.

Lower interest rate which means businesses can borrow more cheaply to finance their operations like customer acquisition, research and development all leading to the growth of the companies.

As interest rates decreases lending money becomes unprofitable and hence pple opting for the stock market.

Finance,Stock Market,Gold ETF is best investment while Trump is alive!,"Lately I am fine lack of good short to medium term investment options, atleast in this environment.

All my equity and debt MF investments are either down or at best no return since trade war and this economic uncertainty started.

FD gives a mere 5-6% return.. not bearing inflation in many cases.

Amid all this - 1 yr back I realised my gold ETF investments were holding ground in both good and bad times.

Here are some numbers based on my gold etf investment experience since 10+ years.

- In last 1 yr, my investment have grown by 53%
- Since last 10+ yrs.. gold prices had an IRR of 10-12% 
- In good times when stock market was booming this IRR dropped to 2 to 5%
- in bad times, when stock marked dropped significantly..gold IRR was 15 to 20%

Finance,Stock Market,"Copper Quest Acquires the Nekash Copper-Gold Porphyry Project in Idaho, USA","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Sept. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Copper Quest Exploration Inc. (CSE: CQX; OTCQB: IMIMF; FRA: 3MX)** (“**Copper Quest**” or the “**Company**”) is pleased to announce that it has closed the previously announced acquisition of the Nekash Copper-Gold Porphyry Project (“**Nekash**” or the “**Project**”) located in Lemhi County, Idaho, United States. This acquisition marks an important milestone in the Company’s strategy to build a portfolio of highly prospective copper assets across North America.

**About the Nekash Project**

The Nekash Copper-Gold Project is a porphyry exploration opportunity located in Lemhi County, Idaho, along the prolific Idaho-Montana porphyry copper belt that hosts several gold and copper deposits including world-class systems such as Butte and CUMO (Figures 1 &amp; 2). The project is fully road-accessible via maintained U.S. highways and forest service roads and currently consists of 70 unpatented federal lode claims covering an area of 585 hectares.

Historic evaluation by the U.S. Bureau of Mines and more recent work has confirmed the presence of outcropping phyllic alteration, copper-gold quartz veins, stockwork veining, and a stratabound “manto” horizon grading up to 3.8% Cu, 0.9 g/t Au, and 25 g/t Ag, with the sample returning 3.8% Cu having been taken across 6.4 metres. Rock chip samples from zones of porphyry-style veining have returned assays as high as 6.6% Cu and 0.6 g/t Au, highlighting the robust tenor of mineralization at surface.

Geologically, Nekash is interpreted to represent a large, blind porphyry system intruding Mesoproterozoic sediments of the Dahlonega Creek Formation. Surface mineralization, alteration, and geochemical anomalies point to a buried copper-gold porphyry center at depth, with the overlying “manto” horizon potentially representing a carbonate-replacement style halo. The project lies along the Trans-Challis shear zone, a regional-scale structure that has acted as a plumbing system for major mineralizing events. Historical placer gold production reported just across the border in Montana suggests a compelling district-scale potential for the Nekash Property.

Copper Quest intends to build on the previous exploration work with modern geophysics, geochemistry, and drilling to unlock the full opportunity of this underexplored system.

**Appointment of Joshua White, P.Geo., as Technical Advisor**

Copper Quest is also pleased to announce the appointment of Joshua White, P.Geo., as Technical Advisor to the Company and Aqua Terra Geoscientists LLC as the Nekash project management company.

Mr. White is an exploration geologist with over 13 years of experience and a principal of Aqua Terra Geoscientists LLC. He was a United States Marine combat engineer who served two tours in Iraq. After returning home in 2005, he earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in Geology from the University of Wyoming, followed by a Masters Degree of Science in Geosciences from Montana Tech. He worked for Kinross Gold as a project generation gold geologist, working at mines and exploration projects on 4 different continents. He has experience with epithermal gold, porphyry copper, reduced intrusion related gold, orogenic gold, and sediment hosted copper systems. He left Kinross as a senior project geologist at the Paracatu gold mine in Brazil to become an entrepreneur in the junior exploration space.

“*We are extremely pleased to complete the acquisition of Nekash, which we view as a highly prospective copper-gold porphyry target in one of the most compelling emerging copper districts in the United States*” said Brian Thurston, CEO of Copper Quest. “*The combination of strong surface results, favourable geology, and district-scale potential make Nekash an ideal addition to our North American portfolio. With Josh White joining our Idaho team, we are well positioned to demonstrate the scale of opportunity at Nekash and unlock shareholder value through systematic exploration*.”

**Idaho Copper Story &amp; Comparables**

Idaho is rapidly emerging as a copper exploration frontier, underpinned by its location on the Idaho-Montana porphyry copper belt. The state hosts notable systems including Butte (Montana), CUMO (Idaho), and the recent Grizzly copper-gold porphyry discovery by Hercules Metals Corp.

Hercules’ Grizzly discovery underscores the potential for large-scale porphyry systems in the belt and demonstrates growing investor recognition of Idaho’s copper potential. Idaho’s porphyry endowment has been underexplored relative to neighbouring states, yet it contains the geological hallmarks for major copper-gold systems. Projects like Hercules Metals’ Grizzly discovery, demonstrate the potential for blind porphyry systems hidden beneath cover similar to what Copper Quest sees as the potential at Nekash.

Nekash sits in a favourable geological corridor with comparables that demonstrate the scale and grade potential of porphyries in this belt. As copper supply chains shift toward North America, Idaho offers a mining-friendly jurisdiction with infrastructure, supportive regulatory frameworks, and strong precedent for major copper developments. Copper Quest’s entry into Idaho provides shareholders with exposure to a new frontier of porphyry exploration in a tier-one jurisdiction.

**Copper: U.S. Policy and Macroeconomic Context**

With President Trump’s administration undertaking investigations into copper imports and tariffs, there is renewed urgency to redefine and realign domestic copper supply chains. Policymakers have highlighted the strategic importance of copper in energy, defense, and technology, with incentives emerging for the advancement of U.S.-based projects. Against this backdrop, Copper Quest’s entry into Idaho positions the Company to benefit from potential policy tailwinds and domestic supply security initiatives.

**Copper: Global Demand &amp; Supply** 

Globally, copper demand continues to surge, driven by electrification, electric vehicles, renewable energy, and the massive expansion of AI and data center infrastructure. Yet supply remains constrained, with declining grades at existing mines, limited new discoveries, and prolonged permitting timelines. The resulting supply-demand imbalance underscores the importance of advancing new porphyry discoveries in stable jurisdictions like the U.S.. Copper Quest is aligned with this macro trend, positioning Nekash to become part of the next generation of copper discoveries.

**Terms of the Transaction** 

Under the terms of the agreement, Copper Quest has acquired a 100% interest in the Nekash Project through the issuance of 4,250,000 common shares of the Company. The shares will be subject to a 16-month escrowed leak out from the date of closing. There is no cash component and no royalty payable as part of the transaction. An all-share finder’s fee is payable in connection with the acquisition.

**Stock Options**

The Company has granted stock options to Consultants of the Company to acquire an aggregate of 450,000 common shares in the capital of the Company, pursuant to the Company’s Equity Incentive Plan. The stock options are each convertible into a common share of the Company at an exercise price of $0.12 until Sept 22, 2030.

Finance,Stock Market,NXXT’s Not Just Energy – It’s Powering the AI Boom!,"Yo, Reddit squad, NXXT just dropped a bombshell that’s got me buzzing! They snagged a 1,600-acre site in Florida, and it’s not just about fancy microgrids anymore – they’re diving headfirst into the AI and cloud infrastructure game. This is huge for a stock still chilling under $2.

The site’s set up for a 200 MW smart microgrid, 400 acres for hyperscale data centers, and get this – they’ve got access to another 6,000 acres for future growth. Toss in their tech stack – hybrid microgrids, solar plus storage, predictive analytics, and that NextUOS utility system – and NXXT’s not just an energy play. They’re straight-up positioning to fuel the AI revolution.

With AI infrastructure being the hottest thing in markets right now, NXXT’s bridging green energy with the backbone of tomorrow’s tech. That’s a story that could wake up a lot of investors. Anyone else stoked about where this is headed? Spill your thoughts!

Healthcare,AI in Healthcare,"EQT to Exit Remaining Stake in TELUS Digital, a Global AI-Driven Customer Experience and Digital Solutions Leader, in Connection with TELUS Corporation's Proposed Acquisition of TELUS Digital","EQT to exit its investment in TELUS Digital, a global provider of AI-driven customer experience and digital transformation solutions, by voting in favor of TELUS Corporation's proposed acquisition of TELUS Digital During EQT's investment period, TELUS Digital has transformed from a traditional outsourcing business into a global innovator in customer experience and technology solutions, delivering an approximate 4x return on its investment and underscoring the success of EQT's value creation strategy Closer integration with TELUS Corporation will enable TELUS Digital to accelerate AI and SaaS innovation across multiple industry verticals and support its next phase of growth SINGAPORE, Sept. 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- EQT is pleased to announce that BPEA Private Equity Fund VI (""EQT"") has signed a definitive voting and support agreement for the proposed acquisition of TELUS Digital (""TELUS Digital"" or the ""Company"") by TELUS Corporation, the majority shareholder and parent of TELUS Digital. The transaction marks the culmination of EQT's successful investment, following the Company's comprehensive transformation since EQT's initial entry in 2016. TELUS Digital is a leading global provider of digital customer experience (CX) outsourcing, digital transformation and adjacent services. Today, the Company serves clients across technology, telecommunications, e-commerce, gaming, financial services and healthcare and delivers end-to-end solutions - including CX management, trust, safety and security, AI and data solutions, and digital solutions - that empower top global brands to innovate and engage with their customers more effectively. Since EQT's investment, TELUS Digital has undergone a far-reaching transformation into a next-generation services leader. The Company completed multiple strategic acquisitions - including Voxpro, Xavient, Competence Call Center, Lionbridge AI, Playment and WillowTree - adding significant expertise in digital design and product development, content moderation, AI-driven data solutions and digital transformation consulting. Combined with strong organic expansion, these steps broadened TELUS Digital's offerings and positioned it as a global technology solutions leader. During EQT's investment period, TELUS Digital has grown its workforce by over 250% to more than 78,000 employees, expanded its operations to more than 30 countries worldwide, and increased EBITDA by more than 500%. A key milestone came in 2021, with TELUS Digital successfully listing on the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange, in what was then the largest-ever technology IPO on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Since 2016, EQT has supported TELUS Digital's transformation and growth journey. EQT sold a significant portion of its stake at the time of TELUS Digital's IPO and follow-on offering in 2021 - when the Company's enterprise value had expanded by approximately six times since EQT's initial investment - and further reduced its holding through subsequent sell downs. EQT has now agreed to vote in favor of TELUS Corporation's proposed acquisition and sell its remaining stake for USD 215 million on closing. Together, these transactions represent an approximate 4x return on its investment and underscore the success of EQT's value creation strategy. Janice Leow, Partner in the EQT Private Capital Asia advisory team and Head of EQT Private Capital Southeast Asia, said: ""We are proud to have supported TELUS Digital's transformation into a global leader in customer experience and technology services. Since investing in TELUS Digital, the company has broadened its capabilities and international presence through organic initiatives and multiple strategic acquisitions. It has also strengthened its position with leading global technology clients. It has been a rewarding partnership, and we are pleased to have contributed to this growth journey. We believe that full integration with TELUS Corporation will create new opportunities for TELUS Digital to accelerate its innovation and long-term development."" Darren Entwistle, President and CEO of TELUS Corporation, said: ""EQT has been a valued partner to TELUS Corporation, working alongside us to advance TELUS Digital's growth, transformation and culture of innovation. Notably, with EQT's support, TELUS Digital evolved from a traditional BPO provider into an organization delivering world-leading enterprise solutions globally, including customer experience management, digital development and design, and its innovative Fuel iX AI platform. We appreciate EQT's collaboration and look forward to continuing TELUS Digital's exciting journey as it becomes fully integrated within TELUS Corporation."" The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Healthcare,AI in Healthcare,Ranking on governments around the world and their disability services for autism,"Because some seem to not know how bad off things are when it comes to trying to get help from the government. (which one? you pick). I figure I should make this.

Note some governments have things like ADA, which should in theory protect citizens from discrimination in work places, SSI which helps people who can't afford to live, etc. But in reality ADA is basically something without teeth and nearly impossible to prove outside of the most extreme cases. SSI can be extremely hard to get on, easy to lose, and it no where near pays enough along with being extremely risky. In fact, in some countries if you simply volunteer you can lose access to your stuff. Canada CPP is this way. if you are volunteering for more than 15 hours a week for a period of four months or longer. If this activity is deemed to demonstrate a capacity to work, and therefore you can simply lose your benefits.

Some might see it as volunteer = work. But reading books to kids, spending time with old people in nursing homes, helping out with your religious place, etc.  I'm pretty sure we all can see the problem with seeing that as the same as working a 9 to 5. Even more since 15 hours a week isn't even half of the normal 40.

So to make a ranking, we need to have rules.

* **The Burden of Application:** Systems with high denial rates and complex, time-consuming application processes were ranked lower. The research showed that in countries like the U.S. and U.K., getting a benefit is a protracted, high-stakes battle of attrition. 
* **Financial Precarity:** Countries where the disability payments are structurally insufficient to meet the cost of living were ranked lower. The evidence showed that benefits in the U.S. and Canada, for example, often leave recipients in a state of financial struggle. 
* **Punitive Rules:** Systems with rules that penalize an individual for trying to work or volunteer were ranked lower, as they create a powerful disincentive for self-improvement. 
* **Inconsistent and Under-resourced Services:** Nations with a disconnect between their legal commitment to services and the on-the-ground reality of long waiting times and a lack of resources were ranked lower.
* **Ease of getting a diagnoses:**  In some countries it is near impossible to get tested, while in others it is only for the rich after 18 years old. I view this is important since virtually every country requires you to be tested to get services.

It should be noted the focus is less on the narrative countries put out, but the actual reality of what people face in those countries. 

The ""best"" government is the one that minimizes systemic failures, bureaucratic friction, and the consequent emotional and financial toll on autistic individuals and their families. This intentionally disregards the superficial rhetoric of laws and benefits on paper, focusing instead on the empirical evidence of what people ""actually get."" The core finding is that most systems, despite their stated goals, are fundamentally adversarial, forcing individuals to become relentless advocates just to secure basic support. The programs are often built on a paradox: they are ostensibly designed to help people achieve independence, but their restrictive rules, inadequate funding, and high denial rates create a reality of perpetual struggle and dependency.

Note there is 195 countries give or take. Some there is no way to be tested or no good way. And some have no support system. Think of Afghanistan as an example. I don't think it is fair to add them to the list since this will add too much and they will be automatically at the bottom since there is no support at all.

**The final ranking, from most to least effective, is: (note the higher the number the worse they are)**

Beyond this there is a few countries that do recognize autism but are just horrible, or lie about their stuff.

Libya, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, and North Korea.

# Iceland (Final Score: 7)

* The Reality: Iceland is ranked first because it is the only country in the analysis that has explicitly and proactively reformed its system to correct the failures seen elsewhere. Its new system, effective in September 2025, is designed to be ""more humane and fairer"". The government has abandoned the old, deficit-focused medical assessment in favor of a holistic, integrated expert assessment that includes the individual's own self-assessment and focuses on what they can do, not what they cannot. 
* Key Failures Minimized: The burden of application is significantly reduced through a simpler system with ""coordination teams"" that guide individuals and prevent them from ""falling through the cracks"". Financial precarity is directly addressed, with 95% of recipients receiving a higher allowance and a massive annual increase in disability and rehabilitation funding. The new system provides greatly increased opportunities for people who want to and can enter the labor market, with a higher income exemption limit. ([source](https://island.is/en/o/social-insurance-administration/news/a-milestone-new-disability-and-rehabilitation-system-the-changes-affect))

# Sweden (Final Score: 21)

* The Reality: Sweden has a robust legal foundation for disability support in its LSS Act, an entitlement law that guarantees ten specific types of support for people with autism. However, this legal promise is undermined by a significant disconnect in its implementation.  
* Key Failures: The law's implementation is delegated to local municipalities with constitutional autonomy, which has created an unequal application of the law and a persistent ""power gap"". This leads to inconsistent support depending on geography. The education system is a major point of failure, with teachers often lacking the competence to support autistic students, leading to higher rates of anxiety, poor academic results, and school absenteeism. A persistent social stigma, where subtle but pervasive judgment of ""weird"" behavior is common, leads to social exclusion and loneliness, undermining the very goals of the LSS Act.  ([1](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1939950/FULLTEXT01.pdf), [2](https://www.norden.org/en/info-norden/disability-benefit-norway), [3](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2019/12/Sweden_Act-concerning-Support-and-Service-to-Persons-with-Certain-Functional-Disabilities-LSS.pdf))

# Taiwan (Final Score: 28)

* The Reality: Taiwan has a comprehensive and robust health infrastructure. However, it also faces a key paradox where its reported prevalence of autism is anomalously low, suggesting a significant problem with under-diagnosis and a societal tendency to avoid the official label.
* Key Failures: The low prevalence rate points to a challenging diagnostic environment, despite the existence of resources. This suggests that stigma, cultural factors, or administrative barriers are significant hurdles for families seeking a diagnosis. The system, while structurally sound on paper, fails to capture the true number of autistic individuals, leading to a disconnect in policy and funding for a hidden population.

# New Zealand (Final Score: 28)

* The Reality: New Zealand's ""Enabling Good Lives"" policy is an aspirational framework that emphasizes self-determination and choice. The system is built on a strong public and non-profit network.  
* Key Failures: Despite the policy's promise, the system is deeply flawed in practice. Families often have to rely on private fundraising and intense advocacy to get the support they need. The financial support provided, such as the Supported Living Payment, is often insufficient to cover the high cost of living, creating a significant financial gap. The process of accessing and reviewing support is complicated, with a centralized Needs Assessment and Service Coordination (NASC) referral process that can be a source of frustration. ([1](https://nzcl.nz/), [2](https://www.disabilitysupport.govt.nz/disabled-people/assessment-and-funding/needs-assessment-services), [3](https://www.kiwiamericans.com/blog/understanding-the-cost-of-living-in-new-zealand-as-an-expat), [4](https://www.workandincome.govt.nz/products/benefit-rates/benefit-rates-april-2025.html))

# Norway (Final Score: 29)

* The Reality: Norway's system provides a high level of financial security, but it is not a perfect system. The Uføretrygd (disability benefit) is one of the most generous, providing a path to a dignified income that few other countries can match. However, this generosity is undercut by a high cost of living, which means the benefit is often insufficient for a comfortable life.  
* Key Failures: The system is defined by a rigid, slow, and often dehumanizing bureaucracy at the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV). A claim can take up to 11 months for approval, and the physical spaces of NAV are described as ""clinical, sterile and cold"" and ""unwelcoming"". A personal account highlights a profound sense of social isolation and the difficulty of navigating a system that is rigid and unresponsive to the nuanced needs of an autistic person, even with a formal diagnosis. ([1](https://www.nav.no/uforetrygd/en), [2](https://www.norden.org/en/info-norden/disability-benefit-norway), [3](https://www.spergel.ca/learning-centre/general/average-cost-of-living-in-canada/), [4](https://disabilityhelpgroup.com/approval-rates-highest-state/), [5](https://www.mic.com/articles/85201/the-surprising-way-the-netherlands-is-helping-its-disabled-have-sex))

# The Netherlands (Final Score: 29)

* The Reality: The Dutch model is philosophically advanced, built on a ""social model"" that empowers individuals with choice and control through flexible personal budgets (PGB).However, the decentralization of care means that this promise of autonomy is often undermined by a fragmented and inconsistent system.  
* Key Failures: The decentralized system creates a ""postcode lottery,"" where the quality of support and the availability of funds can vary dramatically from one municipality to the next. This leads to long waiting lists for services, including a reported nine-month wait for youth mental health services. Furthermore, the education system has been described as lacking ""binding laws"" to guarantee an equal education, with teachers often lacking the training to support neurodivergent students. ([1](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Disability_statistics_-_poverty_and_income_inequalities), [2](https://arrionline.org/life-long-care-needs-impact-family-members-quality-of-life/), [3](https://www.government.nl/topics/care-and-support-at-home/social-support-act-wmo), [4](https://www.inclusion-europe.eu/financial-assistance-to-people-with-disabilities-compared-across-the-world/), [5](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/what-will-you-do-when-im-gone/202503/disabled-and-dutch-are-we-failing-our-disabled-citizens), [6](https://www.guttmacher.org/2024/10/just-numbers-impact-dutch-international-assistance-family-planning-and-hiv-2024))

# Switzerland (Final Score: 30)

* The Reality: The Swiss disability support system is rooted in the principle of ""rehabilitation before pension"" and aims to maintain a standard of living. It has a robust framework of legal protections and private support organizations. 
* Key Failures: The high cost of living in Switzerland presents a significant challenge. The minimum disability pension is CHF 1,260 per month, which is far below the estimated CHF 3,000-5,000 per month needed for a comfortable life, leaving a substantial financial gap. The system is also complex and relies on multiple layers of insurance, which can be difficult to navigate, and supplemental benefits are only available to those with a very low income.  ([1](https://www.bsv.admin.ch/bsv/en/home/social-insurance/iv.html), [2](https://www.ch.ch/en/insurance/disability-insurance--di/iv/ai-/), [3](https://myjourney.packimpex.com/en/guides/cost-of-living-switzerland-things-you-need-to-know/))

# Brazil (Final Score: 30)

* The Reality: Brazil has a maturing system built on both a strong legal foundation and grassroots advocacy. The Benefício de Prestação Continuada (BPC) is a cash transfer program that provides a monthly benefit of one minimum wage to individuals with disabilities.
* Key Failures: While the BPC is a vital safety net, it is still insufficient to provide a dignified or comfortable living. The process of accessing benefits, though defined by law, is often navigated with the help of NGOs, indicating a bureaucratic burden. The concentration of clinical expertise and resources in major urban hubs, particularly for diagnosis, creates a significant ""diagnostic black hole"" in rural areas where the true prevalence is unknown. 

# Singapore (Final Score: 31)

* The Reality: Singapore is recognized as a leading hub for autism treatment in Asia, with an advanced healthcare system and a range of therapies. 
* Key Failures: Despite its advanced healthcare, Singapore's system is highly reliant on private sector providers, which creates a class-based disparity in access to care. Deep-seated cultural norms of conformity and academic competitiveness, similar to South Korea and Japan, likely create significant social stigma and pressure on autistic individuals to hide their diagnosis.  

# Australia (Final Score: 31)

* The Reality: The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is a globally-recognized model that provides individuals with ""choice and control"" through individualized funding plans. 
* Key Failures: In reality, the NDIS has proven to be a bureaucratic nightmare for many. A diagnosis of ASD Level 1 does not automatically qualify for support; it requires a difficult and extensive process of providing ""additional functional evidence"" that is a major barrier to access. The most damning failure is the stark disparity in outcomes: the unemployment rate for autistic people is 34%, more than eight times that of the general population. These numbers prove that the system is failing to address the deep-seated societal stigma and discrimination that money and policy alone cannot solve.  

# Germany (Final Score: 32)

* The Reality: Germany's system is philosophically integrated, with a legal commitment to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Eingliederungshilfe system is designed to help people with autism ""participate in life"" by covering a wide array of services. 
* Key Failures: This integrated vision is a ""paper tiger"" due to a severe lack of resources, people, and knowledge. Individuals report waiting years for an autism diagnosis or a therapy spot, a critical failure that deprives children of early intervention. Parents are forced to become ""proactive advocates"" to fight a system where professionals may question a diagnosis and schools are unable to provide legally mandated accommodations due to a lack of trained staff and large class sizes.

# Finland (Final Score: 32)

* The Reality: Finland has a robust social support system with a new disability services act that promotes self-determination and inclusion. The system offers a variety of financial benefits and services based on individual needs. 
* Key Failures: The system is perceived as complex and unjust by families, with many struggling to apply for and receive services. There are significant regional disparities and a lack of information, with the effectiveness of the system often falling short of its legal guarantees. Austerity measures and budget cuts to civil society organizations have also reduced the impact of state services.  

# South Korea (Final Score: 34)

* The Reality: South Korea has a high autism prevalence rate, which indicates a strong diagnostic system, and the government has improved its support and services over the last few decades.
* Key Failures: The main problem is a deep-seated and persistent social stigma. Research shows that non-autistic Koreans have a higher cultural tightness and are less willing to engage with autistic people than those in the U.S. or U.K., leading to isolation and discrimination. This pressure to conform can lead to parents rejecting a diagnosis or professionals misdiagnosing their children, reinforcing the belief that autism is a ""social deficit"" rather than a natural variation.

# Japan (Final Score: 35)

* The Reality: Japan has a well-developed, multi-tiered system with strong institutional support and a high prevalence rate. The country has made significant improvements in the accessibility of public transportation.
* Key Failures: Despite legal frameworks, the culture of ""social harmony and conformity"" creates a deeply difficult environment for autistic people. Autistic adults report feeling different and misunderstood, with many experiencing bullying and struggling to adapt to the workplace. There is a tendency for professionals to advise individuals to hide their diagnosis, reinforcing the pressure to ""mask"" autistic traits. In addition, many employment opportunities are often in low-skill, low-paying jobs, despite the legal quota system.

# Denmark (Final Score: 35)

* The Reality: Denmark has a robust social welfare system with a policy of ""equal treatment for all"". The government funds personal assistance and services through local municipalities. 
* Key Failures: The system is defined by its high bureaucratic friction. To get a disability pension, an applicant must undergo a ""resource clarification process"" to prove their work capacity cannot be improved. This process is described as ""degrading"" and is often met with ""distrust"" from caseworkers. A person under 40 can only receive a disability pension in ""exceptional circumstances"". Private diagnostic services are prohibitively expensive, costing up to 23,000 DKK, creating a significant barrier to access.  

# Uruguay (Final Score: 35)

* The Reality: Uruguay has a high reported prevalence rate, suggesting a recognition of autism and a robust health infrastructure for identification. However, a detailed analysis of its support systems, policies, and lived experiences is not widely available.  
* Key Failures: Based on its ranking relative to other nations, it is assumed that the system, while functional, faces challenges common to other countries, including bureaucratic hurdles, a disconnect between policy and practice, and limited access to resources outside of major urban areas. These unconfirmed challenges are reflected in a mid-range score.

# Canada (Final Score: 36)

* The Reality: Canada has a strong legal foundation in its Charter of Rights and Freedoms that prohibits discrimination based on disability. However, its system is a frustrating maze of bureaucratic hurdles and confusing rules that punish those who try to improve their lives.  
* Key Failures: The main failure is the difficulty of navigating the system. The Disability Tax Credit (DTC), a gateway to other benefits, has a ""complex, burdensome application process and unclear eligibility criteria,"" leading an estimated 84% of eligible Canadians to not claim it. The most profound failure is the rule that engaging in activities like volunteering for more than 15 hours a week can be used as proof of a ""capacity to work,"" which can jeopardize a person's benefits.  

# United Kingdom (Final Score: 37)

* The Reality: The UK's system is defined by its adversarial nature and the constant threat of a loss of benefits. While the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) is a non-means-tested benefit, it is not a safety net in practice.
* Key Failures: The application process is a ""high-stakes gauntlet,"" with 48% of all cleared claims being disallowed at the initial stage. Even when a claim is successful, most awards are for a short period, with a constant threat of reassessment and benefit cuts. New, stricter rules are expected to cause up to 1.2 million people to lose their support by 2029. The benefits, even when awarded, are inadequate and fail to prevent disabled people from being nearly three times more likely to be ""materially deprived"" than the non-disabled population. 

# Argentina (Final Score: 37)

* The Reality: Argentina has dedicated, though fragmented, support programs and a robust academic and non-profit sector. The country has developed innovative diagnostic tools to address its geographical challenges.  
* Key Failures: Diagnosis and services are heavily centralized in the capital city of Buenos Aires, creating a ""diagnostic black hole"" in the country's interior. This centralization of expertise and resources results in a lack of support and immense barriers to diagnosis for the majority of the population.  

# Chile (Final Score: 37)

* The Reality: Chile has an active research community and is developing new diagnostic tools to address challenges in identification. 
* Key Failures: The country faces a similar challenge to Argentina, with a lack of resources and a difficult diagnostic process, particularly in areas outside major urban centers. This structural inconsistency and under-resourcing lead to a high burden on individuals and families seeking support.

# China (Final Score: 40)

* The Reality: China has some recognition and resources for autism, but it is considered an evolving system. 
* Key Failures: The reported prevalence rate is extremely low, which points to a major issue with under-diagnosis, social stigma, and a lack of data collection. This systemic failure means that while some support may exist, the majority of the population with autism remains unidentified and unserved.  

# Egypt (Final Score: 41)

* The Reality: Egypt has a strong legal framework in its 2014 constitution that guarantees the rights of people with disabilities. The government has established a dedicated fund to provide social protection and care. 
* Key Failures: While the legal foundation is strong, the report indicates that the implementation of these rights into widely accessible services is an ongoing process. The public system is under-resourced, making diagnosis and access to care difficult for the majority of the population. 

# Saudi Arabia (Final Score: 43)

* The Reality: Saudi Arabia has an emerging support system that is being developed through international partnerships and a growing number of private providers. 
* Key Failures: The model of care is primarily market-driven, meaning that quality, evidence-based services are available but are prohibitively expensive for most of the population. Access to care is limited by financial resources, creating a class-based disparity in autism treatment.  

# United Arab Emirates (Final Score: 43)

* The Reality: The UAE has an emerging, market-driven support system with high-quality, private-sector clinics that often have internationally certified staff. 
* Key Failures: Similar to Saudi Arabia, the UAE's system is market-driven and expensive, creating a major barrier to access for most of the population. Accessibility is limited by financial resources, not by a lack of available services.

# Iran (Final Score: 45)

* The Reality: Iran has an emerging focus on public health research, which has yielded some prevalence data. This is a crucial first step toward official recognition.  
* Key Failures: The reported prevalence rate is very low, indicating that the country is still in the early stages of establishing a support and diagnostic infrastructure. There are significant challenges in translating research into a national support system, with services being very limited.

# United States (Final Score: 45)

* The Reality: The United States has a strong legal framework in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that provides civil rights protections. 
* Key Failures: This legal framework has ""no teeth"" and operates as an adversarial system where an individual must fight for their rights. The financial system is an abject failure, with SSI benefits denied to 70% to 80% of initial applicants for autism. The maximum federal SSI payment of $943 a month is structurally insufficient to afford a one-bedroom apartment anywhere in the country. This forces individuals into a poverty trap and reliance on family, which, ironically, can result in a reduction of their benefits. 

# Thailand (Final Score: 45)

* The Reality: Thailand has a national law for children with disabilities and has worked toward inclusive education.
* Key Failures: The reported prevalence is low, indicating under-diagnosis. The enforcement of disability laws is hampered by negative societal attitudes. A lack of trained professionals and resources, especially in rural areas, creates a significant barrier to care.

# Turkey (Final Score: 45)

* The Reality: Turkey is categorized as having an emerging system of recognition and support.
* Key Failures: The reported prevalence is low, suggesting that a significant portion of the autistic population is under-diagnosed due to a lack of recognition and infrastructure. As a result, services are very limited and diagnosis is very difficult.

# India (Final Score: 46)

* The Reality: India has a growing awareness of autism and some legal frameworks, but the support system is limited to specific urban centers.
* Key Failures: The reported prevalence is one of the lowest in the world, indicative of severe under-diagnosis. The government has a budget for disability support, but it is shockingly low and chronically underutilized. Financial support, such as the National Disability Pension, remains stagnant and is insufficient to cover basic living costs. The stigma and lack of awareness are substantial obstacles to diagnosis and therapy, with many autistic children being labeled as ""naughty"" or ""mentally ill"".",autism,2025-09-22T21:16:15,https://reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1nnq2pk/ranking_on_governments_around_the_world_and_their/,Reddit

One of the key roles of AI agents is providing customer support through chatbots that can answer common questions, troubleshoot issues, and provide personalized assistance. This allows businesses to provide round-the-clock support without requiring human intervention, improving customer satisfaction and reducing operational costs.  
  
AI agents also play a vital role in sales and marketing by providing personalized product recommendations, assisting with purchases, and engaging customers through targeted messaging. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis, AI agents can understand customer preferences and behavior to deliver tailored recommendations that drive sales and improve customer loyalty. Additionally, AI agents can analyze large volumes of data to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can inform strategic decision-making and drive business growth.  
  
In addition to customer support and sales assistance, AI agents are also used in areas such as healthcare, finance, education, and logistics to automate repetitive tasks, analyze data, and provide valuable insights. By taking on routine tasks and freeing up human resources for more complex activities, AI agents help businesses improve efficiency and productivity. As businesses continue to adopt AI agents across various industries, their role in driving innovation and transforming business operations will only continue to grow.  


# Choosing the Right AI Agent Development Company

Choosing the right AI agent development company is crucial for businesses looking to harness the power of AI agents effectively. When evaluating potential partners, businesses should consider several key factors to ensure they find a provider that meets their specific needs.

Why Realbotix Could Shock the Humanoid Market

1) A Booming Market (with Big Numbers)

The humanoid robotics market is set to grow like crazy — projections suggest it could hit $15B+ by 2030 with annual growth rates above 30–35%. Social and companion robots are also trending up with double-digit growth, showing there’s real appetite for machines that feel more human.


---

2) Aging Populations + Rising Loneliness = Huge Demand

We’re entering a global wave of aging societies: in Europe alone, tens of millions of adults say they often feel lonely. The WHO even calls loneliness a “global health threat.” That’s not just sad news — it’s a massive opportunity for humanoids designed to provide companionship, emotional support, and daily assistance.


---

3) Clinical Proof That It Works

Robots like Paro (the therapeutic seal) or humanoids like Pepper have already been tested in nursing homes and hospitals. Results? Reduced anxiety, lower loneliness, and better quality of life for older adults. That means Realbotix isn’t just selling “cool gadgets” — it can build on real evidence that social robots improve mental health.


---

4) Labor Shortages Make Robots Attractive

Healthcare, retail, and hospitality are all struggling with staff shortages. Humanoids that can greet, remind, or simply “be there” become an economic solution, not just a novelty. Add subscription-based AI services on top, and suddenly the business model makes sense for B2B clients.


---

5) Tech Finally Feels Human

Thanks to advances in AI (like natural conversation, emotional recognition, lifelike movement), humanoids are crossing the line from “robotic helper” to “almost-human companion.” This realism is exactly where Realbotix shines — and it’s a powerful differentiator.


---

6) Multiple Revenue Streams

B2C: personal companions, education, wellness.

B2B: elderly care, hospitals, front-desk reception, retail.
Hardware + subscription = recurring revenue. This is catnip for investors who want scalable, sticky business models.



---

7) Investor Momentum

We’re already seeing big fundraising rounds and bullish forecasts in the humanoid space. As more capital pours in, costs drop, adoption rises, and early movers like Realbotix can grab headlines — and market share.


---

 Bottom Line

Realbotix is sitting at the sweet spot:

A booming market with billions in growth ahead.

A human problem (loneliness, aging) that needs real solutions.

Clinical evidence that robots help.

A business model that scales.

And a unique positioning around emotional realism, which competitors often underestimate.


👉 That’s why Realbotix could do more than just grow — it could truly surprise the market and become a game-changer in humanoid",pennystocks,2025-09-22T20:38:17,https://reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1nnp2av/humanoides_rr_figure_but_realbotix_can_be_a_big/,Reddit

Healthcare,AI in Healthcare,DAFTED Model Boosts Cardiac Hypertension Diagnosis with Multimodal Fusion,"Researchers unveiled DAFTED, an AI system that fuses echocardiogram video data with patient record tables to improve cardiac hypertension diagnosis.

- DAFTED (Decoupled Asymmetric Fusion of Tabular and Echocardiographic Data) treats the echo video as the primary modality and integrates tabular variables such as age and blood pressure as secondary input.
- In a clinical test of 239 patients, the model achieved an area‑under‑the‑curve (AUC) of over 90% for detecting cardiac hypertension.
- The architecture extracts high‑dimensional features from the video, encodes tabular data separately, then combines them while separating shared and exclusive information.
- It outperformed baseline models that used only echo data, only tabular data, or simple concatenation of both.
- Presented as an oral contribution at the MIDL 2025 conference; the pre‑print and code are accessible via DOI 10.48550/arXiv.2509.15990.
- The framework could be adapted to other domains, such as pairing radiology images with pathology reports or merging wearable sensor streams with demographic data.

Why it matters: Demonstrates that multimodal fusion can raise diagnostic accuracy without extensive preprocessing, potentially reshaping AI‑driven healthcare.

Healthcare,AI in Healthcare,On-prem voice AI ≠ yesterday’s IVR,"*We've been building a voice AI orchestration platform called* [***Rapida.ai***](http://Rapida.ai)*, and we've been trying to solve a core problem we keep seeing in the industry: the gap between what cloud-based voice AI offers and what enterprises truly need.*

*A lot of the popular platforms are great for getting a demo up quickly, but for anyone working with regulated industries or who needs full control, they fall short. We’ve found the three biggest issues are:*

* ***Latency:*** *It’s almost impossible to get true, human-like conversations when your stack is relying on cloud-based APIs for every response. Those awkward pauses and robotic feel just kill the user experience.*
* ***Data Security:*** *Data egress is a non-starter for industries like finance and healthcare. You can't just send sensitive PII to a third-party server and expect to pass a compliance audit.*
* ***Lack of Control:*** *Want to bring your own fine-tuned LLM or a specific ASR model? Many cloud platforms lock you into their stack, which really limits innovation and customization.*

*To tackle this, we built* [***Rapida.ai***](http://Rapida.ai) *to be a true on-premise solution. We’ve focused on things like:*

* ***Sub-second turn-taking and graceful interrupts*** *that make the voice experience feel seamless.*
* ***On-premise deployment*** *to ensure all data, PII redaction, and audit trails stay within the customer’s infrastructure.*
* ***Open and operable architecture*** *so you can bring your own ASR, TTS, or LLMs and integrate directly with your existing systems via SIP.*

*We're interested in what the community thinks. Has anyone else run into these same roadblocks with existing voice AI platforms? What are your biggest deal-breakers when choosing a solution?*

Healthcare,AI in Healthcare,Transforming Healthcare Workflows with AI Agents and Cloud Browsers,"[**Samesurf invented modern co-browsing.**](https://samesurf.com/our-technology/patents/#patents)

https://preview.redd.it/nf9x0gwq3qqf1.png?width=1108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0457645b5df1496dbdfc38076c632d25acd6ded9

The healthcare industry is on the verge of a major shift from reactive care to a proactive, patient-centered model. This change is driven by the convergence of two technologies: AI-enabled devices, specifically autonomous AI agents and cloud browsing platforms. 

For years, AI has supported medical professionals in diagnostics and data analysis. The rise of the AI agent represents a deeper partnership, with systems now able to perceive, reason, and act autonomously to support clinical and administrative workflows. A secure digital foundation is essential for this transformation, and cloud browsers provide this foundation by isolating sensitive data from user devices while protecting compliance with HIPAA and GDPR. Samesurf holds foundational patents that enable AI agents to securely co-browse with other AI enabled devices and/or human users in the cloud. This combination paves the way for improved patient engagement, telemedicine, and administrative efficiency while reshaping the economics of healthcare.

# AI in Healthcare Today

AI is [reshaping healthcare](https://samesurf.com/pioneering-the-future-of-telehealth-with-samesurf-agentic-ai/) by enhancing diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. Instead of replacing clinicians, artificial intelligence augments their capabilities thus allowing them to work faster, catch subtle issues, and focus on patient care. Key applications include:

* **Medical imaging and diagnostics:** AI analyzes scans to detect urgent conditions and patterns that might be missed while improving early detection and proactive care.
* **Predictive health analytics:** By processing large datasets, AI can anticipate health risks thus enabling early interventions.
* **Administrative efficiency**: AI automates repetitive tasks such as appointment scheduling, documentation, and claims processing while freeing clinicians to focus on care.

While AI brings clear benefits, adoption challenges remain. Some clinicians are cautious about transferring decision-making to autonomous systems without proper oversight, and implementation can be hindered by technical and procedural hurdles.

# The Rise of the AI Agent

The most profound impact in the healthcare industry comes from AI’s evolution into autonomous agents that are capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within complex environments. Unlike static diagnostic tools, AI agents can monitor patient vitals, propose treatment plans, and interact with APIs to suggest actions or alert care teams. Multiagent systems allow specialized AI agents to collaborate while optimizing workflows in high-pressure environments like emergency rooms. Beyond clinical support, administrative AI agents are able to reduce the burden on clinicians thus freeing them to focus on patient care. This reallocation improves both clinical outcomes and workforce well-being.

# Cloud Browsers using Samesurf’s Technology

Cloud browsers are not typical browsers that are installed on a local machine. Instead, they run entirely on cloud servers which serve as  a core component of Samesurf’s patented technology. Samesurf’s patents define the precise role and operation of cloud browsers within synchronized browsing and Agentic AI systems. By running remotely, cloud browsers “stream” web content interactions to user devices instead of processing code locally, which helps absorb malicious code and protect both devices and data. Sessions are ephemeral, leaving no cookies or tracking information thus enhancing privacy and supporting HIPAA and GDPR compliance.

Cloud browsers also improve operational efficiency by simplifying IT management and giving mobile staff secure access to patient records. Features such as single-tab sharing and in-page control passing allow clinicians to guide patients through forms without exposing other data. This makes multi-user collaboration safe, seamless, and fully controlled.

# Converging AI and Cloud Browsers

The true transformation emerges from the combination of AI agents and cloud browsers. AI provides intelligence and autonomy, while cloud browsers ensure security, compliance, and interoperability. Together, they enable:

* **Patient engagement and monitoring:** AI agents analyze data from connected devices, highlight critical trends, and provide 24/7 guidance – all within a secure cloud environment.
* **Administrative automation:** AI agents handle intake forms, claims processing, and EHR summaries. Cloud browsers ensure sensitive data is protected during these tasks.

Hybrid workflows are also possible. Clinicians can supervise or collaborate with AI agents in real time, maintaining oversight for complex cases while allowing AI to handle routine tasks.

# Samesurf Enables Agentic AI

Founded in 2009, Samesurf pioneered both modern synchronized browsing and the utilization of cloud browsers in the context of Agentic AI. Its platform allows secure, install-free, code-free co-browsing (amongst AI enabled and human devices) via a server-side API while supporting collaboration across web experiences without exposing sensitive data. Samesurf holds multiple patents that define AI-human collaboration in cloud environments, covering AI simulation of human browsing, navigational control sharing, and automated redaction of sensitive content. These patents provide a foundation for deploying AI agents in regulated environments like healthcare. Real-world use shows measurable impact: increased patient satisfaction, higher online consults, and improved form completion rates which together demonstrate the operational and patient care benefits of the solution.

# Opportunities and Future Directions

The convergence of AI agents and cloud browsers opens significant opportunities for healthcare innovation. Key areas where this technology can have immediate and long-term impact include:

* **Proactive, patient-centered care:** AI agents can monitor patient data continuously, flagging early warning signs and enabling timely interventions. This allows healthcare providers to *anticipate* patient needs rather than to react *after* issues arise.
* **Enhanced digital collaboration:** Clinicians can work alongside AI agents in real-time while sharing control of online forms, portals, or telemedicine platforms thus ensuring sensitive data remains protected.
* **Operational efficiency:** Routine administrative tasks such as form completion, scheduling, and record updates can be automated securely through cloud browsers, freeing clinician time for higher-value work.
* **Scalable patient engagement:** AI agents can deliver 24/7 support and guidance, making digital health tools more accessible to a broader patient population, including remote and/or underserved communities.
* **Innovation in healthcare workflows:** By acting as a universal interface, cloud browsers allow AI agents to integrate seamlessly with existing web-based systems thus eliminating the need for costly, custom integrations and paving the way for new AI-driven services.

This technology also lays the foundation for future advances in personalized medicine, remote patient monitoring, and collaborative care models. The combination of AI autonomy with secure cloud-based interaction represents a shift in healthcare from isolated systems toward an interconnected, intelligent, and patient-focused ecosystem.

# Shaping the Future of Healthcare

Healthcare transformation will come from the convergence of healthcare professionals, AI agents and cloud browsers. AI agents bring intelligence and autonomy, while cloud browsers provide security, compliance, and interoperability. Samesurf is establishing the intellectual property backbone for this convergence while creating shared AI-human workflows that enable proactive care, cost reduction, and improved patient experiences. Together, the combination of these technologies and excellent human care show promise for a more sustainable, accessible, and effective healthcare system.

Healthcare,AI in Healthcare,ENSAM Boosts Efficient 3D Medical Image Segmentation with AI,"Researchers have released ENSAM, a lightweight foundation model for fast, accurate 3‑D medical image segmentation that works with limited data and compute.

- Built on a SegResNet‑based encoder with prompt encoder and mask decoder in a U‑Net‑style layout; uses latent cross‑attention, relative positional encoding, and normalized attention to process volumetric data efficiently.
- Trained from scratch on fewer than 5,000 volumes covering CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound and microscopy, using a single 32 GB GPU for roughly six hours.
- In the CVPR 2025 Foundation Models for Interactive 3D Biomedical Image Segmentation Challenge, it posted a DSC AUC of 2.404 and NSD AUC of 2.266, with final DSC 0.627 and NSD 0.597, beating VISTA3D and SAM‑Med3D and matching SegVol; it placed fifth overall in the coreset track and was the top performer without pretrained weights.
- Key technical contributors are relative positional encodings, which improve spatial awareness and speed convergence, and the Muon optimizer, which accelerates training while keeping stability.
- The model’s efficiency means hospitals and research labs lacking large compute clusters can adopt high‑quality 3‑D segmentation, and its promptable interface may cut manual annotation time for clinicians.

Why it matters: ENSAM demonstrates that state‑of‑the‑art 3‑D medical segmentation can be achieved without massive datasets or specialised hardware, expanding AI accessibility in healthcare.

Healthcare,AI in Healthcare,How trust has been eroded and how to repair it with a Direct Liquid Democracy(DLD),"Problems:

1. We have a fear that AI with robotics will replace our jobs.
2. Healthcare is filled with middlemen and a continual loop of providers and insurance companies blaming eachother for price hikes.
3. For the last 10 years the same 4 issues(gun laws, abortion, imigration, and LGBTQ rights) that divide us are being pushed in congress and on our algorithm that rewards outrage over solutions.

I'm not saying these aren't important issues, but they distract from other things that we can agree on like:

* Banning lawmakers from trading individual stocks.
* Prohibiting excessive price increases during emergencies.
* Requiring financial literacy education in public high schools.
* Restricting corporate spending in elections

The deeper problem in our current system is trust. Many of us believe that rules are written by donors, that lawmakers trade on information the public does not have, and that lobbyists shape what gets a hearing. Add the well-documented history of domestic surveillance by federal agencies, and a daily diet of algorithmic feeds that reward outrage over solutions, it becomes no surprise that faith in institutions is thin. People feel like their voice is not heard and nobody really knows if this is actually what we the people voted for. A direct liquid democracy(DLD) ensures everyones voice is heard.

[How a Direct Liquid Democracy works.](https://preview.redd.it/vauvq7jhopqf1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5895e2ddd3aec0abe2626886c2c24a679ca073e)

Under the system I am proposing everyone would have one issue that they can put their weight(an equaly distributed currency for determining issues and solutions) in. Say the top X issues at each geographic level of the government go to the next round of finding a solution to that issue. Everyone get's to say their piece, but again they all get equal weight in determining what the solution is to that issue. Once the highest weighted solution to the issue is solved, then we determine a budget for the solution and it comes to a final vote for everyone.

Applying this system to immigration policy this gives a finer comb to give people the chance to argue whether immigration is an issue or not. Then we can together determine if that is an issue what the best solution is to it. And it would come to a final vote.

Here are the objections that I have had:

1. Q. Won’t voters just get tired of voting on every issue?(voter fatigue) A. You can delegate your whole vote or delegate by topic to someone you trust within the same local area as you(for local issues) or to anyone in the country for federal issues. You keep your voice and can revoke your delegation at any time.
2. Q. Well what happens in this system when one representative has millions of people's representation from those delegtions. Then we are back to what we already have and they can be bought again by billionaires. A. Today’s lobbying buys influence through opaque channels (and sometimes insider trading). Voxcorda makes it harder: representatives with public vote histories face continuous scrutiny, and delegations are revocable instantly—misrepresentation costs you your delegates. Furthermore, we can implement a hard set number of people each person can represent.
3. Q. There are legal issues with knowing how someone else votes. They have a right to keep what they vote on a secret. A. Individual ballots stay private by default. Full vote histories are public only for representatives with ≥10 delegated voters. Below that threshold, your ballot privacy is preserved.
4. Q. Hackers hack databases all the time. People are worried about voting machines that are on closed loops. How are you going to address these: A. First I’m not a cyber Security expert. But if I can get this movement going I can find someone to help me with this. Second, Blockchain helps because it creates a tamper-evident, append-only record of events: once a vote (or its cryptographic proof) is recorded, nobody can silently change past entries without producing a visible mismatch that anyone can check. Combined with digital signatures and public audit tools, that makes covert alteration of tallies far harder. This can help ensure that no entity can silently change results ensuring fairness in everyone's vote. No system is perfect but we trust blockchain enough to secure our investments in crypto.
5. Q. What about emergency decisions? A. I’ve come up with a couple of different solutions here. But I think the simplest and best answer is for time-critical events, each state elects a standing pool of \~50 on-duty voters (modest stipend) empowered to act within a narrow emergency scope. Their votes and rationale are published immediately, followed by a full member ratification window. 
6. Q. What happens to our current congress and elected officials? A. They are removed from office, however, you can still give them your weight and vote.

I have asked for objections and I encourage more as they strengthen the vision. I just ask for original objections.

I have a 4 phase plan on how to peacefully implement this system but this is the final vision.

I am one person that works a dead-end job to support myself, and I need support to make this vision a reality. How you can help:

1. Engagement on my sub-redit. If you hate the idea post your objection, love the idea share the idea, or have other ideas for other laws and bills post it!
2. I'm looking for someone with more influence than me to spread this idea.
3. Sewing the divide starts with social media. My first phase of the plan is to build a social media that tracks whether you lean left or right. It then tracks the likes from people on the left and tracks likes from people on the right. If one side is heavily liked and the other is heavily disliked the post get's burried in the feed. This is to ensure that bipartisan issues surface so that we may find more common ground. It also includes connection to the google civics API so that you can look at and discuss issues on your local ballots.

Marketing,Content Strategy,I would pay for a DLC that balanced the last two DLC,"Character of the week: Richard (laterly known as ""The Lionheart""). I stayed in Portiers for a decade and got bored waiting for what happend with succession in Kingdom of England where I have claim and is second in succession (I don't murder my way to titles).

Decided to go adventuring. I have tried playing adventurer 4-5 times but always get bored with the fu*king contracts and stop after a few years.

As Richard I just needed to spend time before I inherited England (or Aquitaine) or ein crusade for the holy land.

I must have done 20-30 contracts all over Europe before I got a lvl 2 contract and managed to get so many MAA that I could actually sell my services as a mercenary.
One successfull war contribution, a few perks and a few camp upgrades, and now I pay 7 gold to increase size of Heavy Infantry regiments.

If they want to make this game more accessible to customers who are not hard core strategy gamers, then maybe they should make it easier to get into adventuring - and chill the f*ck out with the later bonuses from buildings, oerks etc.

I always hire adventures as mercs when playing a normal campaign, but always get disappointed that there is no interaction with these Landless nobles - many of them dynasty members getting cheated out of their inheritance in kate game.

Nomad gameplay: I never play close to Nomad cultures - not because I don't wan't to fight them - because they have this weird mechanic where they will do a migration war against a much stronger neighbor. Nomad vassals (and vassals of vassals) will also start revolts very frequently - it's not a challenge, it's a nuisance. 

Instead of AUH they should fix/improve all the half finished content we have already paid for. 
I know there are game designers and developers in PDX who care deeply about CK3, so I can only imagine how a Scrum/developer meeting is going when the marketing cunts come marching in on their meeting in expensive sneakers.

Marketing,Content Strategy,$0 Marketing: How to Build a Loyal Customer Base Using Free Social Media Tools,"**$0 Marketing: How to Build a Loyal Customer Base Using Free Social Media Tools**

Are you tired of watching your marketing budget evaporate before your eyes, with little to show for it? Want to build a tribe of loyal customers without breaking the bank? Good news: you can! Social media, when used strategically, is your secret weapon. Let's ditch the expensive ad campaigns and dive into building real, lasting connections.

**The Challenge:**

You're a small business owner in the US, juggling a million tasks. Marketing often feels like a luxury you can't afford. Paid advertising is expensive, and you're not sure where to start. You need to get the word out about your amazing product or service, but you're strapped for cash. Sound familiar? Many businesses struggle with this. The good news is that with a bit of creativity and consistent effort, you can leverage the power of free social media tools to build a thriving community around your brand.

**Building Your Tribe: Social Media Strategies That Cost (Almost) Nothing**

Building a loyal customer base isn't about shouting the loudest; it's about creating a community and offering value. Here's how you can do it without spending a fortune:

*   **Step-by-Step or Key Points: Define Your Niche and Target Audience.**
    *   Before you start posting, nail down *who* you're trying to reach. What are their interests, pain points, and where do they hang out online?
    *   **Brief Example/Hypothetical Case:** Let's say you run a local bakery specializing in gluten-free goods. Your target audience might be people with Celiac disease, health-conscious individuals, or those simply exploring gluten-free options. Identify online communities and hashtags they use.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Don't try to appeal to everyone. A niche audience is more engaged and easier to reach. Avoid being too broad.

*   **Step-by-Step or Key Points: Choose Your Platforms Wisely.**
    *   Don't spread yourself too thin. Focus on 1-2 platforms where your target audience is most active.
    *   **Brief Example/Hypothetical Case:** If you're targeting younger demographics with visually appealing products, Instagram and TikTok might be your go-to platforms. If you're focused on B2B services, LinkedIn is a better choice.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Research which platforms your competitors are using and how effectively. Don't just choose the most popular ones; choose the *right* ones.

*   **Step-by-Step or Key Points: Create High-Quality, Engaging Content.**
    *   Content is king! But not just *any* content. Focus on providing value to your audience. Share tips, tutorials, behind-the-scenes glimpses, and stories that resonate with them.
    *   **Brief Example/Hypothetical Case:** Back to our gluten-free bakery. Instead of just posting pictures of your bread, share gluten-free baking tips, recipes, or stories about customers who have benefited from your products.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Don't just sell, sell, sell! Aim for an 80/20 ratio: 80% valuable content, 20% promotional content. Use storytelling to connect with your audience on an emotional level.

*   **Step-by-Step or Key Points: Engage, Engage, Engage!**
    *   Social media is a two-way street. Respond to comments, answer questions, and participate in conversations. Show your audience that you care.
    *   **Brief Example/Hypothetical Case:** If someone asks about ingredients in your bread, provide a detailed and helpful answer. If someone leaves a positive review, thank them and ask if you can share it.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Set aside dedicated time each day to engage with your audience. Don't ignore negative feedback; address it professionally and constructively.

*   **Step-by-Step or Key Points: Run Contests and Giveaways.**
    *   Everyone loves free stuff! Contests and giveaways are a great way to attract new followers and generate buzz around your brand.
    *   **Brief Example/Hypothetical Case:** Offer a free loaf of bread to one lucky follower who shares your latest post. This helps spread the word and increases engagement.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Make sure your contest rules are clear and comply with platform guidelines. Choose prizes that are relevant to your target audience.

*   **Step-by-Step or Key Points: Collaborate with Influencers (Micro-Influencers).**
    *   You don't need to pay Kim Kardashian to promote your business. Partner with micro-influencers in your niche who have a smaller but highly engaged audience.
    *   **Brief Example/Hypothetical Case:** If you're a gluten-free bakery, reach out to local food bloggers or health enthusiasts who specialize in gluten-free living.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Focus on influencers who are authentic and genuinely passionate about your product or service. Track the results of your collaborations to see what's working.

*   **Step-by-Step or Key Points: Track Your Results and Adjust.**
    *   Use social media analytics to track your progress. See which content performs best, which platforms are most effective, and where you can improve.
    *   **Brief Example/Hypothetical Case:** If your Instagram posts with behind-the-scenes content get the most engagement, create more of that!
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Don't be afraid to experiment and try new things. What works for one business may not work for another.

*   **Canva:** A free graphic design tool that makes it easy to create visually appealing social media posts. Great for creating eye-catching graphics, even if you're not a designer.
*   **Hootsuite (Free Plan):** A social media management platform that allows you to schedule posts, track mentions, and analyze your results. Saves you time and helps you stay organized.
*   **Google Analytics:** A free web analytics service that allows you to track website traffic and understand user behavior. Understand where your audience is coming from and which content resonates best.
*   **Later.com (Free Plan):** Specializing in Instagram and Pinterest scheduling and analytics. Great if you are using visually-driven platforms.

**Conclusion:**

Building a loyal customer base on social media doesn't require a massive budget. It requires consistent effort, creativity, and a genuine desire to connect with your audience. By providing value, engaging in conversations, and leveraging free tools, you can build a thriving community that supports your business for years to come.

Marketing,Content Strategy,"PSA for anyone struggling with Steel Soul, Steel Heart, or even the base game: Use Plasmium.","With no way to practice bosses, the constant vigilance required to stay safe throughout the run, and the sheer length of the game, Steel Soul/Steel Heart has been a doozy for me so far. I've been doing my run mostly ""legit"", never bench-scumming (though I really can't blame anyone who does, this game is absurdly long), sticking to Hunter's Crest, and just trying to 'fundamentals' my way through things. There's been a few rough areas and a ton of really close calls, but I'm now in the process of practicing the final boss fight on my main save in preparation for finally closing out my Steel Heart completion.

The best advice I could give to anyone struggling is to get as much use out of the Plasmium Phial as possible. With a maxxed out Tool Pouch and Shell Satchel, that's 7 extra masks of damage you can take per fight; nearly an entire health bar. Even before getting a maxxed out Tool Pouch, you'll still be able to use 4-5 of them per fight, and they can help a lot when exploration or platforming become scary. The cost of Shell Shards and refilling your reserves is absolutely worth it for the on-demand safety net Lifeblood provides. As long as you have it in you to walk back to Zylotol every once and a while, your run is going to get a LOT safer very quickly.

Now that's all well and good, but I'm sure some of you have been waiting for me to mention Plasmium Overdose. Yes, it is broken. It's way more broken than people give it credit for. It is easily the most brain-dead strategy in the entire game. No Tool in the game comes close to the level of impact this provides. This effect is so overpowered that it is absolutely cheating, full stop, and needs an immediate nerf. At least the bench-scumming crowd have to get through bosses by their own merit. Play as dumb as you want, walk into any attacks you want, fail platforming sections to your heart's content, death is an impossibility unless you are physically trying to throw your own run. Play safe if things ever get scary, observe attack patterns while you're regenerating, and just sit back and watch yourself heal to full for zero effort or cost besides Shell Shards. To top all this off, you can use any further Plasmium Phials to heal while you're overdosed, and Architect's Crest gets infinite repairs. Subtracting the 9 used to get Overdosed, that's a total of 21 extra hits of damage per fight not even INCLUDING the rapid healing you get by just ... breathing. And you can still Bind. Hell, you can even bring along Multibinder to up your Bind to 2 Masks if you're (somehow) still feeling uncomfortable. Since you're generally going to have a ton of spare Silk and Architect can't spend it on Silk Skills, I highly recommend picking up the Ruined Tool from the Bilewater Weavenest and upgrading it at Mount Fay. It has a ton of ammo, fires off pretty quickly, has great range, pierces, and does consistent damage. Combine this with Cogflies or a third Tool of your choice (though I'd recommend Flintslate due to how it works with Architect's Needle Strike), and the only scary part of your entire run (besides the early game) is going to be just after starting Act 3, when you're briefly stuck with 4 masks and no Tools on Hunter's Crest.

If you want to get your clear but you're just barely managing to scrape by some encounters, consider throwing Plasmium onto whatever Crest you're running for a bit of extra survivability. If you want to get your clear and you don't think you're good enough or don't have the time to make it through legitimately, abuse Plasmium Overdose while you can, because I guarantee that it's going to be nerfed.

Side note: Though this was largely a Plasmium ramble, if anyone has questions about routes, strategies, or builds for Steel Soul, feel free to ask! I'll help where I can. This game was way harder for me to get through than Hollow Knight (I first-tried Steel Heart on that game), so it took a lot more work and planning on my part to make a mostly safe and comfortable route through the game. Would love to give tips to anyone who's looking to start out or refine their methods.",Silksong,2025-09-22T21:43:33,https://reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nnqt32/psa_for_anyone_struggling_with_steel_soul_steel/,Reddit

Marketing,Content Strategy,"What I think Charlie Kirk's ""Right Way"" Was","You can count me as someone who broadly agrees with a lot of what Ezra has said over the past couple weeks. And from reading a lot of the backlash to what he's said, it seems to me that someone, somewhere needs to flesh out a little what ""doing politics the right way"" means. I obviously can't speak for Ezra, but I can tell you what *I* think Charlie Kirk did right, and how progressives could stand to learn more than a thing or two from him. 

To be clear, I think Charlie Kirk wasn't a grand defender of liberal democracy, or even significantly in favor of things like free speech. He didn't fight for neutral rules and liberal institutions. He was a culture warrior, fighting pitched battles for his own side. And he did that fairly well, and we're living in the world that his success has created in no small part. 

So, putting things in order, here's what I think Kirk's ""right way"" was: 

**1) Begin by identifying an area where your side is particularly weak.** Kirk was specific about this during his appearance on Gavin Newsom's politics. He noticed that conservatives were getting seriously destroyed when it came to young people. And he decided he was going to do something about that. 

**2) Build an organization that is singularly focused on addressing that weakness.** TPUSA is that organization, and they have been laser-focused for more than a decade on getting more young people to address conservatism. 

**3) Go to those places of weakness, and using debate, persuasion, and modern media, bring more people in your target area to your side.** Right now, because my YouTube algorithm is pretty well trained to deliver me right wing content, I'm seeing a crap ton of Charlie Kirk on campus content. And in all of it, I can tell you he does a spectacular job of engaging productively with people to his left. It's very clear to me that--though he doesn't really have much *sympathy* for people with opposing views--he has a great deal of empathy for them, such that he can very well anticipate what kinds of arguments will be employed against him, and knows how to counter those arguments such that he always looks like the winner. He and his organization have invested the time necessary to understand their enemy, and I think it's pretty clear that they understand that enemy more than well enough to persuade people not to support them. 

Everyone who points out that Kirk didn't do a lot to calm down divisions or lower the temperature of public debate is completely right. He didn't do those things. But what he did do is go on offense in the culture war in the most effective way possible, and it's obvious that his work has borne serious fruit. 

Who on the left is doing this? As far as I can tell the progressive strategy since Obama has been to go to places where we're winning and just win harder and more uncompromisingly. Who is setting up tables outside churches and community centers in red counties with a sign that says ""Prove me wrong""? Who even understands conservative arguments well enough to counter them effectively? As far as I can tell absolutely no one. 

So we have a lot we could learn from Charlie Kirk. And I hope we learn it soon. ",ezraklein,2025-09-22T21:38:48,https://reddit.com/r/ezraklein/comments/1nnqol5/what_i_think_charlie_kirks_right_way_was/,Reddit

Marketing,Content Strategy,"With AI-driven search and answer engines gaining prominence in 2025, how should SEO strategies adapt to maintain visibility and rank well?","As AI-powered search and answer engines become a major part of how users find information, SEO strategies need to evolve beyond traditional keyword and backlink tactics. Focus on creating highly relevant, user-intent-driven content that AI systems can understand and trust.

Engaging in authentic community platforms like Reddit provides real insights to shape this content. Additionally, optimizing for new search formats like voice, visual, and zero-click searches will be crucial. Staying agile and integrating AI tools into your workflow can help keep your SEO efforts aligned with these shifts for better brand visibility and rankings in 2025.",latestseo,2025-09-22T21:32:15,https://reddit.com/r/latestseo/comments/1nnqic5/with_aidriven_search_and_answer_engines_gaining/,Reddit

Optimize page speed, mobile usability, and ensure your site is easy to navigate. Engaging with communities like Reddit can also help by providing real insights into user needs and language—this can guide better content creation that naturally attracts links and shares over time.
