Rust,Which MacBook should I buy?,"Hi! I'm new to this community, and I need some help. I'm planning to go to university and am considering purchasing a MacBook. I've never used a Mac or any other Apple device before (I've used Windows 11 and Linux operating systems). For your information, I'm a Python backend developer and plan to learn Rust in the future. I've researched the MacBook and decided to go with the MacBook 16 Pro series.

So which MacBook should I choose: 
+ MacBook 16 Pro 24gb RAM 512gb SSD
or
+ MacBook 16 Pro MAX 36gb RAM 1tb SSD?

As far as I know, the MacBook's RAM and SSD are fixed, and you can only connect external storage devices if you need to expand your storage capacity. I have enough money for both options, but I want to make sure that I'm getting a reliable laptop that will last for at least five years and have good performance.

Also, I would like to ask: how easy is it to switch from Windows to macOS, and are there any advantages of macOS over Windows? Thank you in advance! ❤

Rust,[EU] Looking for a Few More Teammates – Official Monthly,"Hey!  
We’re an experienced Rust group looking to bring a few more **long-term EU players** into the squad. We mostly play on **official monthly servers** and we’re focused on building something consistent — **not a team that vanishes after wipe day**.

# About Us

* Most of us have **4,000–6,000 hours** (one of us is pushing 9k)
* **Chill vibe**, but we take the game seriously when it matters
* All **EU-based**, active most evenings and weekends
* Solid balance across roles — **farming, building, PvP**

# What We’re Looking For

* **EU-based and active**
* Preferably **2,000+ hours** (but being a good teammate matters more)
* **Consistency** — we want people who show up regularly and stick around wipe after wipe
* Willing to **contribute across the board**: farming, base work, PvP, comms
* **Not just here for PvP** – if you only log in to roam and ignore the rest, not for us
* **No solo mindset** – if you don’t log on just because only one person is online, this isn’t your squad

If you're interested, add me on Discord: **Sh1nebze**",playrustlfg,2025-10-05T23:25:53,Reddit

Rust,Condensation pan leaking after being flushed — what should I know?,"I had a tech come out to fix my 11-year-old evaporator coil freezing — filling the system with coolant and leak protection seemed to fix things.

He also “did me a favor” and flushed the drain line.

The next week, I noticed a major leak coming from the rear of the drain pan (roughly the location, the whole unit is embedded in the ceiling in a laundry room). Drywall soaked, floor soaked.

The tech came back and “double flushed” the line for a fee. 🤨 He said that the rust in the pan was clogging the line. Feels fishy.

It’s still leaking. I’ve never had a problem before this repair. The tech is coming back this week.

1. Is it possible this is coincidental and not related to whatever work he did?
2. How much should I grouse about this? Is this a “write it off and find another HVAC company” situation? 
3. Is there anything else I should consider so I don’t get taken advantage of?",hvacadvice,2025-10-05T23:22:25,Reddit

Rust,Leaking toilet,"Hello!  I have a leaking toilet.  The tank sits on the bowl and is attached through the tank by bolts.  One of the bolts has rusted really bad and there is no way I’ll be able to replace the screw and rubber washer without cracking the tank.  The water is dripping down the bolt onto the floor from the bottom of the tank.  I just need a temporary fix that will last a few months until I can get a new potty.  Normally, I would ask my daddy, but I lost him in May and am struggling with home repairs as a new homeowner. I’ve looked into Flex Glue, but not sure if that would work. Any suggestions would be so very appreciated!!  ",askaplumber,2025-10-05T23:00:15,Reddit

Python,Which MacBook should I buy?,"Hi! I'm new to this community, and I need some help. I'm planning to go to university and am considering purchasing a MacBook. I've never used a Mac or any other Apple device before (I've used Windows 11 and Linux operating systems). For your information, I'm a Python backend developer and plan to learn Rust in the future. I've researched the MacBook and decided to go with the MacBook 16 Pro series.

So which MacBook should I choose: 
+ MacBook 16 Pro 24gb RAM 512gb SSD
or
+ MacBook 16 Pro MAX 36gb RAM 1tb SSD?

As far as I know, the MacBook's RAM and SSD are fixed, and you can only connect external storage devices if you need to expand your storage capacity. I have enough money for both options, but I want to make sure that I'm getting a reliable laptop that will last for at least five years and have good performance.

Also, I would like to ask: how easy is it to switch from Windows to macOS, and are there any advantages of macOS over Windows? Thank you in advance! ❤

Python,Feeling a bit lost about my career growth after 6.5 years in IT?,"Hey everyone,


I want to share my software development career journey over the past 6.5 years and get some advice.

Career Overview:Linux Administrator (2.7 years, 3.5 LPA)Developed automation scripts with Bash and Python to manage Linux servers, implemented monitoring tools, and handled system scripting and maintenance. This role helped me build a strong foundation in scripting and automation.


Technical Support Engineer at Infosys (10 months, 5.5 LPA)
Worked closely with software teams to troubleshoot backend systems, wrote SQL queries for data validation, automated log processing, and supported deployment and API integration pipelines.


Data Engineer / Software Developer (3 years, 8.5 LPA)
Currently building and maintaining ETL pipelines using Python, SQL, and Apache Spark. Developed backend microservices with Flask and FastAPI for data processing workflows, automated data ingestion and reporting tools, and worked with cloud deployments.


Despite a okayish software engineering skills and growing responsibilities, my compensation is 8.5 LPA, and I often see others with similar or less experience earning 20–30 LPA in product or startup roles, which makes me question my career trajectory.


Questions:How did you scale your salary significantly after 6+ years in software?What skills, tech stacks, or project types gave you the biggest leverage?Is switching to product tech companies or specializing in cloud/backend the key to growth?Would appreciate insights from fellow backend, data, or software developers who have navigated this.Thanks for reading!",careerguidance,2025-10-05T23:27:19,Reddit

Skip a day, and they’d cut your attendance. Brutal.

Then I joined a highway contractor for NHAI projects, working my butt off in the quality department. I handled tests for subgrade, GSB, WMM, DBM, BC—everything. Checked clay, cement, bitumen, binding materials, managed documentation, and ran around on-site. But the work conditions? Absolute garbage. You’re stuck in some rural “dehaat” with no civilization, no society, nowhere to even spend your money. Even the auto drivers had more civility than the people I worked with. Drivers and machine operators? Mostly uneducated, desperate folks acting like brainwashed zombies with no manners.

I got so fed up that I tried switching careers. Spent a couple of years learning programming—Django, Python, the whole deal—hoping to land a job at a Tier 1 IT company. Got an internship at an insurance aggregator, only to get kicked out when the company merged. Just my luck.

So, I had to crawl back to civil engineering. I thought building projects might be better than highways. Maybe they’d give us Sundays off? Nope. Instead of 12-hour shifts, 7 days a week, these are *14-hour shifts, 7 days a week*. No breaks, no life.

And don’t get me started on the family pressure. My parents are like, “We told you so!” Yeah, I get it, I’m a burden. They wanted me to get a stable job so I could live comfortably, but this is India. There are *no labor rights*, *no employment rights*, nothing. Politicians and CEOs push for construction to be done faster and cheaper, while HR and management types are busy skimming profits—selling everything from food to diesel to line their pockets. No proper nutrition, no hygiene, and these people act like they’re winners just for surviving this mess.

I’m done with the construction industry. Common people complain about bad roads and buildings, blaming engineers like us. Trust me, it’s not our fault. We’re just trying to survive. We don’t need huge salaries—just a Sunday off, a few hours to sleep, and a chance to have a personal life. Is that too much to ask?

Unless you’ve got a NICMAR degree or can work with a non-traditional startup, stay far away. The industry will chew you up and spit you out.",IndianEngineers,2025-10-05T23:16:27,Reddit
Python,3D Multi-Moon Simulation in Python,"We recently finished building a **multi-moon orbital simulation of Jupiter** in Python. It models several of Jupiter’s moons orbiting simultaneously with realistic gravitational interactions and orbital parameters. The simulation currently runs using **Matplotlib animation**, and it visualizes the moons’ paths, orbital resonance, and inclinations pretty accurately.

Our goal was to make something that’s both visually engaging and scientifically grounded — a small step toward a system-scale orbital model.

We’d love to **share it on the web** so people can interact with it, but we’re not sure what the best way to go about that is. Has anyone here converted a Python-based physics simulation into a browser experience before?

Any feedback, ideas, or experiences would be awesome to hear.

Python,Should I just skip Python and go straight to C# for Revit automation?,"Hey folks, I’m a BIM modeller trying to get serious about automating Revit. I’ve been playing around with pyRevit and IronPython, but I don’t have any real programming background yet.

From what I understand:

Python (and IronPython) are easier to pick up and good for quick scripting in Revit.

But C# is Revit’s native language, so it gives full access to the API and way more power/flexibility.


So here’s my dilemma:
If I’ll eventually need to learn C# anyway for full-blown automation, is it worth spending time learning Python first, or should I just skip straight to C# and take the harder route from day one?

Would love to hear from people who’ve gone through this — what path worked best for you, Python first or straight to C#?",bim,2025-10-05T23:13:18,Reddit

I am an AI Engineer / consultant that applies AI automations to real-world businesses. I’ve worked in the software/IT industry for 10+ years. To get hands-on practice, I’d love to help figure out automations for your business **completely for free**.

My plan is also to show you exactly how each part works and have you run the setup in the long-run.

We’ll collaborate on defining the outcomes that you are looking for and I’d be happy to launch the setup in production. I use a variety of tools that range from code heuristics (Python, JS, Ruby), comercial LLMs or models (HuggingFace, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc) and automation tools (n8n, Zapier, Gumloop).

I’m only looking for a testimonial at the end before we conclude the project. Looking forward collaborate with folks",automation,2025-10-05T23:11:21,Reddit

# INTRODUCTION

# So, What is Deep Learning?

There are many definitions out there on the internet which explain Deep Learning, but there are only a few which explain it as it is.  
There are few ideas on the internet, books, and courses I found:

* **“DL is an advanced form of Machine Learning.”**
* **“Deep Learning is just a deeper version of Machine Learning.”**
* **“It’s a machine learning technique that uses neural networks with many layers.”**
* **“It mimics how the human brain works using artificial neural networks.”**
* **“Deep Learning learns directly from raw data, without the need for manual feature extraction.”**

And a lot is still left.

But what I understood is this: Deep Learning is like teaching a computer to learn by itself from data just like we humans learn from what we see and experience. The more data it sees, the better it gets. It doesn’t need us to tell it every rule it figures out the patterns on its own.

So, instead of just reading the definitions, it's better to explore, build small projects, and see how it works. That’s where the real understanding begins.

# What is the use of DL?

DL is already being used in the things we use every day. From face recognition in our phones to YouTube video recommendations — it's DL working behind the scenes. Some examples are:

* Virtual assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant
* Chatbots
* Image and speech recognition
* Medical diagnosis using MRI or X-rays
* Translating languages
* Self-driving cars
* Stock market prediction
* Music or art generation
* Detecting spam emails or fake news

Basically, it helps machines understand and do tasks that earlier only humans could do.

# Why should we use it in daily life for automating stuff?

Because it makes life easy.

We do a lot of repetitive things — DL can automate those. For example:

* Organizing files automatically
* Sorting emails
* Making to-do apps smarter
* Creating AI assistants that remind or help you
* Making smart home systems
* Analyzing big data or patterns without doing everything manually

Even for fun projects, DL can be used to build games, art, or music apps. And the best part — with some learning, anyone can use it now.

# What is the mathematical base of DL?

Yes, DL is built on some maths. Here's what it mainly uses:

* Linear Algebra – Vectors, matrices, tensor operations
* Calculus – For learning and adjusting (called backpropagation)
* Probability – To deal with uncertain things
* Optimization – To reduce errors
* Statistics – For understanding patterns in data

But don’t worry — you don’t need to be a math genius. You just need to understand the basic ideas and how they are used. The libraries (like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch) do the hard work for you.

# Conclusion

Deep Learning is something that is already shaping the future — and the good part is, it’s not that hard to get started.

You don’t need a PhD or a supercomputer to try it. With a normal laptop and curiosity, you can start building things with DL — and maybe create something useful for the world, or just for yourself.

It’s not magic. It’s logic, math, and code working together to learn from data. And now, it’s open to all.",deeplearning,2025-10-05T10:00:14,Reddit

Keras,"[Student]-[0YOE]-[EE] Baltimore, MD - Looking for hardware internships with research and project experience","Hello, I am a sophomore studying electrical engineering. I am currently applying for positions in basically every concentration but I am mainly interested in hardware and embedded. I have applied to \~30 internships and I have only heard back from 3 positions (all auto rejections from defense companies). My current experience is mainly in ML and computer vision from my research, but I have a few embedded projects. I don't think I want to apply for any pure SWE internships just yet since I don't think I am confident that I can pass that many technical interviews since I have not taken DSA or any of the typical CS coding classes, but I might in the future. I'm also wondering if there are any specific concentrations that I might be a good fit for given my resume.

Additional Info:  
\- I am a US citizen  
\- I go to a fairly prestigious engineering university  
\- I would like to stay on the east coast area for this summer

Any help and advice is greatly appreciated!

SQL,Feeling a bit lost about my career growth after 6.5 years in IT?,"Hey everyone,


I want to share my software development career journey over the past 6.5 years and get some advice.

Career Overview:Linux Administrator (2.7 years, 3.5 LPA)Developed automation scripts with Bash and Python to manage Linux servers, implemented monitoring tools, and handled system scripting and maintenance. This role helped me build a strong foundation in scripting and automation.


Technical Support Engineer at Infosys (10 months, 5.5 LPA)
Worked closely with software teams to troubleshoot backend systems, wrote SQL queries for data validation, automated log processing, and supported deployment and API integration pipelines.


Data Engineer / Software Developer (3 years, 8.5 LPA)
Currently building and maintaining ETL pipelines using Python, SQL, and Apache Spark. Developed backend microservices with Flask and FastAPI for data processing workflows, automated data ingestion and reporting tools, and worked with cloud deployments.


Despite a okayish software engineering skills and growing responsibilities, my compensation is 8.5 LPA, and I often see others with similar or less experience earning 20–30 LPA in product or startup roles, which makes me question my career trajectory.


Questions:How did you scale your salary significantly after 6+ years in software?What skills, tech stacks, or project types gave you the biggest leverage?Is switching to product tech companies or specializing in cloud/backend the key to growth?Would appreciate insights from fellow backend, data, or software developers who have navigated this.Thanks for reading!",careerguidance,2025-10-05T23:27:19,Reddit

SQL,Cannot Praise it Enough - static SvelteKit + Go + ConnectRPC = Perfect Stack [self-promo].,"I am a big fan of Svelte + Go for a long time, love this connection (wrote about it multiple times already :D). Also a big fan of gRPC (type-safety, streaming, etc), but the setup was always painful, using SvelteKit (or any full-stack framework) server as a gateway to make it work was always bothering me ;/.

Until I've discovered ConntectRPC (https://connectrpc.com/). This shit is MAGICAL. Fixed all my problems. For those who don't know it, it is able to create both gRPC and HTTP-compatible endpoints. So browser &lt;-&gt; server is HTTP, server &lt;-&gt; server is gRPC. Did I mention great protobufs linting? Remote generation? Did you know modern browsers support streaming via standard HTTP? Yeah, it's amazing.

I will just mention here, that I ADORE Svelte... I've been working with so many different frameworks over my 10+ years of coding, and this one is just something else. The new experimental async makes it even more amazing.

Now for the static SvelteKit, you got all the benefits of the framework (routes, layouts, hooks, errors) without the additional, useless server call. This might be controversial, cos SSR is trendy (https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/single-page-apps), but for me SSR makes sense for public facing sites. Otherwise try to prerender as much as possible, put it on Cloudflare Workers, and forget about it :D MUUUUCCH less headache, and no need to worry about all this ""hmm, will this secret be exposed to the client via some magic shit the framework is doing""....

As for Go? It's just the best, nothing to say here :D

So yeah, try this combination, it's really amazing :)

Now for the \[self-promo\] part, so feel free to skip it :):

You might or might not saw my messages about my Go-focused CLI builder ([https://gofast.live](https://gofast.live/)). I am really happy with how it ended, a lot of configurations, multiple frontends (SvelteKit, NextJS, Vue, HTMX), HTTP + gRPC, payments, files, emails providers, Grafana monitoring, Kubernetes deployment....yeah, there is a lot.... the problem? You either get it ALL or nothing.

So after the discovery of ConnectRPC, I've decided to build a V2 version. And this time I want it to be like ""Lego Pieces"". Won't spend much time writing all the ideas, cos it's BETA. But let's use an example to get the feeling :):

\`\`\`  
gof init my-app  
cd my-app  
gof client svelte  
gof model category title:string views:number published:time  
gof model post title:string content:string views:number published:time  
gof infra  
\`\`\`

So by running these commands (lego pieces :D) you will end up with a fully working app, fully connected, with two new models, ""categories"" and ""posts"", migrations, sql queries, service layer, transport layer, OAuth, all the way to the a functional CRUD UI scaffold, with list/add/edit/remove options for each model. This one is heavily inspired by the Elixir Phoenix (another amazing framework to check out ;) ).

The CLI is smart, so you could even go with Go + models only first, and decide to add svelte at the end :p

Have I mentioned that it will also auto generate all the tests? :D And ofc infra using terraform + auto deployment with CI/CD ... and so much more... yeah, I am excited about this one :D

If any of this sounds interesting, hop on the Discord server, where we like talking about general modern web dev:

SQL,Using math as a differentiator?,"Hi, all!

So, I'm in my early 30s and currently studying to start a data analytics career. I'm focusing on the Microsoft stack at the moment (Power BI, SQL, Excel, and planning to add Azure down the line), and since I've always been pretty good at math, I'd like to know whether I could leverage knowledge of it beyond the basics like measures of central tendency and dispersion, hypothesis testing, etc.

I have maintained a solid grasp of linear algebra, calculus, probability, descriptive statistics (and some inferential, such as hypothesis testing), regression, vector calculus, and combinatorics. So far, I've only needed the statistics when studying data analytics, but especially because I don't have experience in the field yet, it would be quite helpful if I could use any or all of the rest as differentiators. Are there niches where I could do that, realistically?

I have a BSc in computer science, if that context also helps.

Thanks for any help or tips!",dataanalytics,2025-10-05T23:08:14,Reddit

SQL,How to ACTUALLY make your (vibe coded) apps secure (from an actual hacker),"I'm a pentester (ethical hacker) who codes SaaS part-time. I've reviewed hundreds of apps over the years, and honestly? Most have the same holes. Here's what actually keeps you safe.

* **AI code review catches most issues (fr)**

Look, I get it. You're shipping fast. But let Coderabbit review every pull request. It'll catch SQL injection, exposed credentials, broken auth before anything goes live.

Here's a wild one: during a recent pentest, I found a race condition in a client's payment system that was double-charging customers. The dev wrote it late night with AI help. Looked totally fine to them. Would've been an absolute nightmare in production.

* **Rate limiting stops the spam (and saves your wallet)**

I've seen apps get absolutely hammered with 10,000+ fake registrations in minutes. Rate limiting shuts that down real quick.

Without it, you're basically paying for spam. Your database fills with garbage, your email service burns through the monthly quota, and boom: One client ended up with a $500+ AWS bill from a single bot attack. Not fun lol

Start strict: 100 requests/hour per IP. You can always loosen it later if real users complain, but honestly? They won't.

* **Enable RLS from day 0**

Row Level Security means users can only see their own data. Postgres enforces it at the database level, which is exactly where you want it.

Found a dashboard during a pentest once with no RLS. I changed one URL parameter and suddenly I'm looking at everyone's data. That's literally how most data leaks happen - someone forgets this one thing.

Let AI write your RLS policies if you want, but double-check them and actually try to break them yourself.

* **Hide your API keys (seriously)**

API keys in code will get stolen. Not maybe. Will.

During pentests, I find exposed AWS keys, Stripe tokens, database passwords in repos all the time. GitHub bots are scraping for these 24/7: they'll find yours in minutes.

Google Secret Manager or AWS Secrets Manager. That's it. Keys live there, not in your repo. And rotate them every 90 days. Takes like 10 minutes.

* **CAPTCHA stops bots**

I've tested tons of apps with and without CAPTCHA. The difference is honestly massive - we're talking 99% spam reduction.

Without it? You're looking at 200+ garbage submissions daily. ""Buy our SEO services"" and crypto scams filling up your database. It's annoying as hell.

Use invisible mode so real people never even see it. Bots get challenged. Slap it everywhere: contact forms, registration, login, password reset.

* **HTTPS isn't optional**

Every endpoint needs HTTPS. Redirect HTTP automatically. Zero exceptions here.

I intercept unencrypted traffic during pentests constantly, and you'd be shocked what I see. Session tokens, passwords, API keys - all just sitting there in plain text. It's 2025, people.

Let's Encrypt gives you free certificates. There's literally no excuse.

* **Sanitize every input**

Validate on the frontend. Validate again on the backend. Trust nothing users send you - and I mean nothing.

During pentests, I'm injecting malicious code through forms, URL parameters, file uploads. Most apps fail this test. Don't be most apps.

* **Update your dependencies**

Old packages have known vulnerabilities. When I'm testing security, those are the first things I go after.

Turn on Dependabot or Renovate. Update monthly at minimum. Security patches? Apply them the same day. This one's non-negotiable.

AI makes you fast. But speed without security is just... well, it's just speed toward disaster.

Here's what works: one AI writes your code. Another AI (Coderabbit) audits it. You review the audit. Three layers catching issues before they become problems.

Also, rate limiting protects you when things go right too. Your app goes viral? Traffic spikes 1000x overnight? Limits keep your servers up and your costs reasonable.

From pentesting hundreds of apps: these controls stop 95% of attacks. The other 5% requires skills most hackers don't have, so you're good.

Seriously: I've seen apps lose 40% of users after breaches. $50,000+ incident response bills. Reputations take years to recover.

These controls work. Clients stay. They send referrals.",ChatGPTCoding,2025-10-05T23:02:59,Reddit

SQL,Issues with Supabase Vector Store and AI Agent on n8n,"Hi! Sorry for interrupting your scroll, but I'm new to this and I'm having a pretty annoying issue happening in one of my workflows, I hope you can help me to understand what's happening and possible help me find a solutions to it.

I'm creating a chat bot agent to reply to the customer of one of our clients, it has 3 subAgents that help with the DB extraction, 2 working with SQL (working fine) and 1 with Vector DB (the one with issues), but I'm facing something unexpected with the Vector tables.

When the subAgent calls the tool Supabase, it has the instruction to look for the embedded data that is back from the embedding tool to add it to the query, but the node is not sending any vectors to the call, returning an empty array back from the DB.  I've been struggling to make it work, here's what I have already done:

1. Recreate the Vector Table twice (I'm using Gemini text-embedding-004 at 768 vectors)

2. Changed and tried to ""hardcode"" the instructions to the agent in hopes to kinda force the append of the vectors in the query.

3. Changed the instructions on the subAgent too to try the same approach as in the Main agent

At this point I have been with this for a week and nothing seems to work, is there a workaround I can do to fix this?

SQL,"Career shift - CSM, SAM, Tech Support Engineer?","At my job I’ve had major complaints about the current role I have of Enterprise Strategic Account Manager. I’ve had virtually no boss due to poor staffing choices by the company and no leadership/guidance (let alone the role keeps shifting responsibilities). In my meetings, my current “boss” who has never been with CS before has helped me find another role at the company for Technical Support Engineer. My whole career has been in healthcare data management.

The new role has no salary attached yet, but actual definitions for responsibility. I’m really happy about not having external meetings anymore, although there is an on call schedule, and I’m not sure what my career path would be by going down Technical Support Engineer.

There’s no guarantee that the company will be stable. I’ve been a CSM for about 7 years now and can’t find anyone with a shred of technical understanding and good presentation skills internally and externally involved. Super frustrating when I have to emotionally babysit boomers all day that decide my fate and can’t open an excel file let alone read all my formulas. I have had a single client churn, and yet can’t get a promotion to save my life while my bosses just shoot to the C level status.

Technical Support Engineer would be just tickets externally with mostly internal triaging, larger company priority shifting, and product management. I’d be running data validation across SQL queries in Azure and AWS, HTML and API troubleshooting, Snowflake and AthenaOne data comparison, and learning Python along the way.

I think the move would be more aligned with my work style but I’m able to ride without much manual effort as a CSM, just a hella amount of emotional burnout.

I might be able to wiggle this towards Technical Account Manager or something of that manner to go towards engineering while keeping the flexible schedule of a CSM or SAM that can bounce if nothing is wrong and there’s no meetings.

Is Technical Support Engineer a step down? A step to the side or up? What’s the market like for support of that level? What’s on call felt for people who shifted into that kind of schedule? Any red flags I should look for?

TL;DR I’ve been in CS for 7 years and stagnated there regardless of higher technical knowledge and only one client churn ever. Hiring has been overblown with poorly performing sales people with more personality. I’ve been offered a position as a Technical Support Engineer and don’t know if this is a good move for career stability and growth?",careerguidance,2025-10-05T22:38:55,Reddit
SQL,Is the web hosting business in recession?,"I have been working in web hosting as an all-in-one sysadmin for over 15 years, and I was a beta tester of digital nomadism. My current job is as a remote contractor, and I bill by the hour. For a long time, this was fine because I could decide how much I wanted to work within an agreed range, but in the last year, work has slowed down considerably.

So I thought maybe it was just the company I work for and started looking at other hosting companies, I thought it would be easy to get something extra because I am flexible to work 10-30 hours, do night shifts, I can cover almost any position (from support to complex setups), and as a remote contractor I charge less than a formal employee. I even handle emergencies 24/7/365!!

But what I discovered is that nobody seems to be hiring,  many companies don't have staff after office hours and technical support is being outsourced to people without knowledge or to AI bots.

I am considering moving into another field, but I don't want to lose my years of experience with LAMP, WordPress, nginx, MySQL, cpanel, plesk, webmin, AWS, DNS, email, firewalls, networking, VPS, CDN, etc.

There are sources that help host such websites but the paid ones make you pay by the month and it is done project so I am not really going to use it the entire month, Makes me not wanting to pay for it every month. It would have been lovely if I could have paid for by the fixed hour like 120 Rs for 75 hr that would be nice but they don't give such offers it is usually 60 Rs-150 Rs per month and it is a waste of money if I am not using it on daily basis.

Java,"Odisha gears up for holy Kartika month: A time of faith, fasting and devotion","As the auspicious month of Kartika draws near, Odisha readies itself for a period of deep spirituality, ritual observance, and cultural vibrancy. Known as the holiest month in the Hindu calendar, Kartika is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva, and holds immense significance for devotees who observe strict religious vows, charity, and fasting during this sacred time.From temples adorned with lights to river ghats filled with the fragrance of incense and chants, the entire state transforms into a devotional landscape. For many Odias, Kartika is not merely a religious observance, it is a way of life that symbolises purity, faith, and the triumph of devotion over indulgence.When The Holy Month Begins...The month of Kartika usually falls between October and November, beginning the day after Laxmi Puja and concluding with Kartika Purnima, the full moon day. According to the Hindu calendar, it is considered the most auspicious month for worshipping Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva.Devotees across Odisha adopt a vegetarian lifestyle during this period, refraining from non-vegetarian food. Many also opt out onions and garlic during the sacred month. Many people also undertake vows of celibacy and austerity, dedicating their days to prayer, cleanliness, and charity.Religious Significance And RitualsKartika is often described as the month of penance and devotion. Each Monday during this month holds special significance for devotees of Lord Shiva, who observe fasts and offer prayers at temples, especially the Lingaraj Temple in Bhubaneswar and Loknath Temple in Puri and Dhabaleswar in Cuttack.For Vaishnavites, the month is equally sacred as it honours Lord Vishnu. Temples like Jagannath Temple in Puri and Ananta Vasudeva Temple witness a surge of devotees during this time.Habisyalis: The Devout Widows Of KartikaOne of the most striking features of the Kartika observance in Odisha is the presence of Habisyalis, widowed women, who travel from across the state to Puri to lead a life of spiritual discipline for an entire month.They follow a strict routine, eating only once a day, a simple meal known as Habisa Anna, prepared without spices. They spend their days in prayer, visiting temples, and taking holy dips in sacred tanks like Narendra Pushkarini, Swetaganga, and Markandeya Pokhari.The Puri district administration and police make special arrangements every year for their accommodation and safety, with designated lodging centres and round-the-clock security.Also Read: Devotees to get free ‘Mahaprasad’ at Puri Jagannath temple soon: Odisha Law MinisterKartika Purnima: The Grand ConclusionThe holy month culminates with Kartika Purnima, the full moon day considered the most auspicious of all. On this day, devotees take early morning baths in rivers, ponds, or the sea and offer diyas (lamps) to the holy waters, symbolizing the triumph of light over darkness.The sight of tiny boats made of banana bark or paper, carrying lamps, flowers, and betel leaves, floating on the rivers and ponds at dawn is one of Odisha’s most beautiful spiritual spectacles.Bali Yatra: Remembering Odisha’s Maritime GloryKartika Purnima also marks the beginning of the famous Bali Yatra, celebrated in Cuttack. The festival commemorates the ancient maritime legacy of Odisha’s Sadhabas, traders and sailors, who once sailed to Southeast Asian countries like Bali, Java, and Sumatra for trade and cultural exchange.People float symbolic paper boats in memory of those voyages while the Bali Yatra fair, one of Asia’s largest open-air trade fair, lights up Cuttack city with cultural performances, food stalls, and traditional crafts.Also Read: Odisha’s ‘Bali Yatra’ to make historic debut in British Parliament this NovemberA Month of Faith and ReflectionKartika month, often called the ‘month of salvation’, blends faith, simplicity, and community spirit. Whether it’s the solemn discipline of the Habisyalis, the devotion of Monday fasts, or the joyous floating of boats on Kartika Purnima, the observance reflects Odisha’s enduring connection between spiritual devotion and cultural identity.As the lamps drift away on the water, they carry with them prayers for peace, purity, and prosperity, marking the end of one of Odisha’s most sacred and soul-stirring months.",odishatv,2025-10-05T05:18:08,NewsData

Java,"Indonesia school collapse death toll rises to 36, search for bodies continues","JAKARTA: The number of students confirmed dead after the collapse of an Islamic boarding school building in Indonesia rose to 36, from 16 a day earlier, the country’s disaster mitigation agency said on Sunday.Efforts continued for a seventh day to search for the bodies of 27 students still declared missing - mostly teenage boys from the ages of 13 to 19 - trapped under the rubble, the agency said.Cranes were deployed to excavate debris and search and evacuation efforts were 60% complete, according to the agency, which said it expected to clear all debris and finish the search on Monday. ‘Maybe there’s hope’: Indonesian rescuers race against time to save students trapped under collapsed school The Al Khoziny school in the town of Sidoarjo in East Java province caved in last Monday, collapsing on top of hundreds of teenage students during afternoon prayers, its foundations unable to support ongoing construction work on its upper floors.On Friday, rescuers received the parents’ permission to make use of heavy equipment after failing to find signs of life during previous efforts.Rescuers dug through tunnels in the remains of the building, calling out the boys’ names and using sensors to detect any movement, but found no signs of life.Al Khoziny is an Islamic boarding school known locally as a pesantren.Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, has about 42,000 pesantren serving 7 million students, according to religious affairs ministry data.",brecorder,2025-10-05T05:03:37,NewsData

as we can see, it's basically whining about missing resources. it's likely trying to load the new ""cairo"" design which doesn't exist in this base app version

to get around that, i had to follow this discussion from jpa102: https://github.com/jpa102/revanced-discussions/discussions/11

i simply edited the `revanced_prefs.xml` file and find the spoof app version entry, then set it back to `19.26.42` to stop the crashing

***

why `19.16.39`? this is the last youtube version to feature the old deprecated seekbar thumbnails which exists inside the app, and there's a patch that restores it",VancedDiscussions,2025-10-05T23:30:33,Reddit
