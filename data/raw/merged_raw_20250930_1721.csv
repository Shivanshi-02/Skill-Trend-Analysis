Python,"Stories from running a workflow engine, e.g., Hatchet, in Production","Hi everybody! I find myself in need of a workflow engine (I'm DevOps, so I'll be using it and administering it), and it seems the Python space is exploding with options right now. I'm passingly familiar with Celery+Canvas and DAG-based tools such as Airflow, but the hot new thing seems to be Durable Execution frameworks like Temporal.io, DBOS, Hatchet, etc. I'd love to hear stories from people actually using and managing such things in the wild, as part of evaluating which option is best for me.

Just from reading over these projects docs, I can give my initial impressions:

* Temporal.io - enterprise-ready, lots of operational bits and bobs to manage, seems to want to take over your entire project
* DBOS - way less operational impact, but also no obvious way to horizontally scale workers independent of app servers (which is sort of a key feature for me)
* Hatchet - evolving fast, Durable Execution/Workflow bits seem fairly recent, no obvious way to logically segment queues, etc. by tenant (Temporal has Namespaces, Celery+Canvas has Virtual Hosts in RabbitMQ, DBOS… might be leveraging your app database, so it inherits whatever you are doing there?)

Python,Ship stats comparison tool - compare the stats of ships with each other or with means and medians,"Wrote a simple comparison tool in python. It has two functionalities: to compare the stats of a selected ship with the means and medians of other ships in the same class to see where it stands, and to simply bring up the stats of two ships side by side to allow for at a glance comparison. Here is the link to the repo:

The data is from the Azur Lane wiki list of stats of all ships. It currently has no UI and so simply runs in the terminal. The main program is in the form of the .exe file in the repo but the source code is also present in the repo.

People may be rightfully apprehensive about downloading and running an .exe file from a random on the internet, so if one has python installed, they can instead just download the entire repo and run the .py file. If you'd rather not download anything at all then I can understand that too. A tool like this it would be best presented as a web page. 

The ultimate goal would be easy side by side comparison of the theoretical performance between ships as well as how their theoretical performance fits in with ships of the same class, same class and rarity etc. which of course you'd need to take into account efficiencies and skills. I suppose my two main questions in this post are: 

1. Is there a tool already out there that already does this?  
2. If not, is this even worth further looking into? Would it be useful? ",AzureLane,2025-09-30T17:03:44,Reddit

Python,Beyond the Lore: My Concept for a Real-World Glimmer.,"What I am gonna share is not more sci-fi this is real thing nor fandiction. This doc is based on real scientific research paper and the real scientific study going on. This doc states the real road map to make a **Glimmer** or more genericaly speaking a **Photonic crystal** that stores light. (This what possible with modern technolgy right now) . Why I am shareing this because I am just a collage student I don't have a team nor lab to do this. What I need an actual lab and budget to this research.😓

# Phase 1: Understand and Model the Physics

1. **Literature Sweep**
   * Gather seminal and recent papers on photon storage, slow light, and light trapping in photonic crystals and resonators.
   * Focus on mechanisms like Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT), cavity QED, and photon–atom hybrid states.
2. **Build a Simple Python Model**
   * Implement Maxwell’s equations for a 1D photonic crystal using libraries such as MPB or MEEP.
   * Verify that a photonic bandgap stops targeted wavelengths.

# Phase 2: Design and Optimize the Photonic Crystal

1. **Parametric Crystal Design**
   * Write Python scripts to sweep parameters: lattice spacing, refractive index contrasts, defect-cavity geometries.
   * Compute bandgaps and identify configurations that maximize photon dwell time.
2. **Quantum-Level Loss Mitigation**
   * Conceptualize error-correction via periodic control pulses or active feedback loops to compensate for scattering and absorption losses.

# Phase 3: Simulate the “Solidified” Light System

1. **Material + Control Algorithm Integration**
   * Combine the optimized crystal model with a feedback algorithm (PID controller or RL agent) to actively maintain photon confinement.
2. **Quantify Energy Storage**
   * Calculate how many photons at a given wavelength can be trapped and for how long.
   * Derive the effective energy density (“10 g stores 10 kJ” scale estimates).

# Phase 4: Prototype Fabrication and Testing

1. **Lab Collaboration**
   * Partner with a nanofabrication facility or maker space capable of nanoimprint lithography, electron-beam lithography, or self-assembly.
   * Start with microsphere or waveguide test structures if full photonic-crystal fabrication is unavailable.
2. **Iterative Loop**
   * Fabricate test pieces, measure confinement lifetimes and losses.
   * Feed experimental data back into the Python optimization scripts for next-generation designs.

# Phase 5: Define and Develop the “Glimmer” Product

1. **Concept Specification**
   * Decide on Glimmer’s form factor: a light-battery module, a photonic memory element, or a functional light block.
   * Design the release mechanism—controlled energy discharge, optical signaling, or visual display.
2. **Documentation and IP Strategy**
   * Record experimental methods, simulation code, and performance metrics.
   * File provisional patents or prepare publications to protect and communicate your innovation.",DestinyLore,2025-09-30T17:01:03,Reddit
Python,Finding the Right Product Development Firm in Karnataka: A Deep Dive for Businesses,"Karnataka, with its epicenter Bengaluru, stands as the undeniable heart of India's technological revolution. Dubbed the ""Silicon Valley of India,"" this state is a magnet for innovation, talent, and entrepreneurial spirit. For businesses, both established enterprises and ambitious startups, looking to launch a new digital product or transform an existing one, the sheer volume of product development firms in Karnataka can be both an opportunity and a challenge.

How do you cut through the noise to find a partner that not only understands your vision but can also execute it with precision, scalability, and strategic foresight? This deep dive will guide you through the critical factors, due diligence, and strategic considerations for selecting the ideal product development firm in Karnataka to ensure your project's success.

**The Karnataka Advantage: More Than Just a Name**

Before diving into selection criteria, it's crucial to acknowledge *why* Karnataka is a prime location for product development:

* **Unparalleled Talent Pool:** Home to premier engineering institutions and a thriving tech ecosystem, Karnataka offers access to a vast pool of highly skilled software engineers, AI/ML specialists, UI/UX designers, and product managers.
* **Innovation Hotbed:** The state’s dynamic startup culture fosters an environment of rapid iteration, cutting-edge technology adoption, and a problem-solving mindset crucial for modern product development.
* **Cost-Effectiveness (Relative):** While not the cheapest, the combination of high-quality talent and competitive pricing often yields superior value compared to Western markets.
* **Global Exposure:** Many firms in Karnataka have extensive experience working with international clients, understanding global best practices and diverse market needs.

**Beyond the Brochure: 7 Critical Factors for Selection**

Choosing a product development firm isn't about ticking boxes; it's about finding a true partner. Here are the paramount factors to evaluate:

1. **Specialized Domain Expertise:**
   * **The Nuance:** Does the firm genuinely understand *your industry* (e.g., FinTech, Logistics, Healthcare, Industrial IoT)? A generalist might build functional software, but a specialist understands the unique regulatory challenges, user behaviors, and specific terminologies of your sector.
   * **Action:** Look for case studies, client testimonials, and team experience specifically within your domain. A firm that speaks your industry's language will accelerate development and minimize costly misunderstandings.
2. **Product-First, Engineering-Driven Philosophy:**
   * **The Nuance:** Many firms are excellent at coding. But true product development requires a ""product mindset"" – a focus on user needs, market fit, and business outcomes *before* writing a single line of code. They should be able to challenge your assumptions constructively.
   * **Action:** Inquire about their product discovery process, their approach to defining Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), and how they integrate UI/UX design from the outset.
3. **Technical Prowess &amp; Technology Stack:**
   * **The Nuance:** Are they proficient in modern, scalable technologies? This includes cloud-native architectures (AWS, Azure, GCP), microservices, robust backend frameworks (Node.js, Python, Java), modern front-end stacks (React, Angular, Vue.js), and mobile development.
   * **Action:** Discuss their approach to scalability, security, and maintainability. For AI-driven products, assess their expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, MLOps, and data science. A strong firm will be technology-agnostic but deeply proficient in tools that deliver robust solutions.
4. **Agile Methodologies &amp; Transparent Communication:**
   * **The Nuance:** Modern product development thrives on agility. A firm should use iterative development (Scrum, Kanban) allowing for flexibility, continuous feedback, and rapid adaptation. Transparency in progress, challenges, and decisions is non-negotiable.
   * **Action:** Ask about their communication cadence (daily stand-ups, weekly demos), project management tools, and how they handle scope changes. Look for a partner who prioritizes clear, consistent dialogue.
5. **Robust Security &amp; Compliance Frameworks:**
   * **The Nuance:** For any digital product, especially in regulated industries like FinTech or HealthTech, security is paramount. Compliance with data protection laws (GDPR, DPDPA) and industry standards isn't optional.
   * **Action:** Inquire about their internal security protocols, data encryption practices, penetration testing, and their experience navigating regulatory landscapes relevant to your product.
6. **Scalability &amp; Post-Launch Support:**
   * **The Nuance:** An MVP is just the beginning. The product needs to scale seamlessly as your user base grows. A good firm considers future growth from day one and offers ongoing support, maintenance, and further feature development.
   * **Action:** Discuss their DevOps capabilities, cloud infrastructure management, and their philosophy on long-term partnership versus a one-off project.
7. **Proven Track Record &amp; Client Validation:**
   * **The Nuance:** Claims on a website are one thing; independent validation is another.
   * **Action:** Request detailed case studies relevant to your needs. Critically, seek out and scrutinize reviews and testimonials on independent B2B review platforms like [**Clutch.co**](http://Clutch.co)**, G2, or industry-specific forums.** Talk to past clients if possible.

**Due Diligence Checklist: Your Actionable Steps**

* **Initial Research:** Scour firm websites, LinkedIn profiles of their key personnel, and industry reports.
* **Portfolio Review:** Demand a detailed portfolio with specific examples of similar projects.
* **Team Meet &amp; Greet:** Insist on meeting the actual development team members who would work on your project, not just sales or project managers. Assess their technical depth and cultural fit.
* **Proposals &amp; Scope Definition:** A good proposal goes beyond a price tag; it outlines methodology, timelines, deliverables, and how risks will be managed.
* **References:** Always ask for client references and follow up on them.
* **Trial Project (Optional but Recommended):** For larger engagements, a small, paid discovery phase or a mini-project can be a low-risk way to assess compatibility and quality before committing fully.

Python,"Gaming and productivity, ideally&lt;$2000","LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE

Total budget: US $2000

Are you open to refurbs/used?

Only if there is a good warranty 

How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life

Looking for solid build quality and performance, don't care about battery life. I prefer a less flashy appearance (minimal/no RGB) but it's not a deal breaker.

How important is weight and thinness to you?

Not very.

Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.

16 inches, but willing to consider others 

Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run

Dark table, gimp, QGIS, CPU-heavy Python (sklearn)

If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?

No Man's Sky, Dead Island 2, 60 fps on High


Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?

Build quality is important. I want this to last 5+ years if possible.

Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.

No Lenovo, I'm here because my Legion 7 motherboard died for the second time, so I'd rather go with a different brand.

I have SSDs and RAM from my deceased Legion 7, so I'm really just looking for good CPU, GPU, and screen.",SuggestALaptop,2025-09-30T16:48:56,Reddit

Python,Hospedagem de Bots: O Que É e Como Escolher a Melhor Opção,"A **hospedagem de bots** vem ganhando cada vez mais espaço no mercado digital, principalmente com o crescimento do uso de automações em empresas, e-commerces e até projetos pessoais. Um bom serviço de hospedagem garante estabilidade, segurança e desempenho para que os bots funcionem sem interrupções.

Mas afinal, o que é a [**hospedagem de bots**](https://squarecloud.app/pt-br/bots)? Trata-se de um serviço em nuvem ou em servidores dedicados que mantém programas automatizados ativos 24 horas por dia. Esses bots podem desempenhar diversas funções, como atendimento ao cliente, gerenciamento de redes sociais, envio de notificações, moderação de comunidades online ou integração com sistemas internos.

Uma das principais vantagens é a disponibilidade. Com a **hospedagem de bots**, você não precisa manter seu computador ligado para que o programa funcione. O bot fica ativo no servidor, garantindo operação contínua e maior confiabilidade para tarefas importantes.

Outro ponto essencial é a escalabilidade. À medida que a demanda aumenta, a **hospedagem de bots** permite expandir os recursos de memória, processamento e armazenamento, sem comprometer a performance. Isso é especialmente útil para projetos em crescimento.

A segurança também é um fator decisivo. Bons provedores oferecem proteção contra ataques, backups automáticos e sistemas de monitoramento que asseguram o funcionamento dos bots sem falhas. Isso dá tranquilidade a empresas que dependem dessas automações no dia a dia.

Além disso, a flexibilidade é um grande atrativo. A **hospedagem de bots** pode ser configurada para rodar diferentes linguagens e frameworks, como Node.js, Python ou Java, atendendo desenvolvedores de diversas áreas.

O custo-benefício é outro aspecto positivo. Hoje, é possível encontrar planos de **hospedagem de bots** acessíveis, que oferecem excelente performance a preços competitivos. Essa democratização do serviço permite que pequenos negócios e startups também adotem a tecnologia.

Em resumo, investir em **hospedagem de bots** é garantir praticidade, segurança e eficiência para automações digitais. Seja para negócios, projetos pessoais ou comunidades online, contar com um servidor dedicado a manter seus bots ativos é um passo essencial para o sucesso no ambiente digital.",SeoProExpert,2025-09-30T16:47:42,Reddit

I am just not sure which paints and primers to buy. I heard that the Majic 1 gal. Black Tractor Truck &amp; Implement Enamel Paint can be painted on with a brush and does require any additive but im not sure if thats true. Does tractor supply sell a good 2k epoxy primer that would work with that Enamel paint? I have also heard that people have used the rust oleum Pro paint and brushed it on.

Rust,Deserted Carnival: Calliope Echoes for Children Who Never Stopped Playing,"You can hear it before you see it. That’s the strange part. The music comes thin and cracked, drifting through dead trees like smoke. The old calliope still plays, though everyone swears the carnival shut down decades ago. I didn’t believe it at first not when the stories were whispered in cafeterias, nervous kids daring one another to cross the dusty field where the Ferris wheel rusts against the skyline. I thought it was a myth. But then, one evening, I walked that way myself. I thought I’d only pass by. I thought it wasn’t real.

The song found me first air wheezing through busted brass pipes, uneven and wrong, like someone trying to remember a tune but forgetting the order with every breath. That’s when I smelled the faint, sweet burn of candied sugar. Imagine finding the scent of melting cotton candy when the midway is nothing but weeds and wire. That’s how it hooks you. It feels familiar. Warm. Almost like safety. And then the air begins to tighten around you, and it loses that warmth.

I stepped closer. I shouldn’t have.

The rides stand there, leaning forward, waiting. The carousel horses are frozen mid-gallop, their painted eyes peeled wide, chipped mouths open as if screaming. The games hang waiting too, prizes sagging in waterlogged rows, faded bears and rabbits with glassy eyes that look back. It feels like the moment just before lights turn on, just before the crowd comes pouring in except there is no crowd. Never again. But the carnival keeps itself alive, refusing to rot all the way through. And at the very center of it, I saw the calliope.

It doesn’t look like it should work. Rust crawls across its pipes, wooden panels blackened by weather and age. And yet, as I stood there, the keys pressed down one by one, invisible hands pounding out that chipped and broken song. It wasn’t just sound it was an invitation.

That’s when the children came.

They aren’t alive anymore. You see it instantly. Their movements stick and jolt, like puppets with tangled strings. Their clothes are wrong too, from different decades, stiff with years of dust. But their faces God, their faces those are not young anymore. They aren’t children’s faces, not really. Skin stretched too thin. Eyes sunken dark with hunger. Teeth chattering, though not from cold. Have you ever seen someone smile while starving? That’s what it looks like.

They came in shuffling groups, climbing down from Ferris-wheel seats, crawling out from the cracked funhouse mirrors, swinging stiff and slow from the monkey bars in the rusted playground beyond the gates. They whispered to each other in short, sharp bursts, giggling like kids playing hide and seek. But there was nothing playful in it. Their voices came out hollow, carved down by years of echoing through empty throats.

One girl stepped forward. A dirty lace bow still clung to her hair. She tilted her head at me, listening, as if I had already joined their game. “Tag,” she rasped, and her smile spread too wide.

The others followed her lead.

They ran without running. It’s hard to explain. One moment they were at the rides, the next they were closer, skipping forward in perfect rhythm with the blare of the calliope. Every note pulled them quicker, closer, their laughter cutting sharper, building and building and building. I tried to step back but my legs felt stiff, sluggish, the air around me folding in, weighing me down. The sound vibrated inside my chest, pressing against my ribs like it belonged inside me, not in the air at all.

The closer they came, the more real they felt not like ghosts, but like children who had never stopped playing, never stopped running, never stopped feeding off the carnival’s endless night. And I realized then that none of them looked older than twelve. They had been here a long, long time, but they weren’t allowed to grow. They were stuck between laughter and death, mouths stretching in the space between the two.

“Play with us,” the girl whispered. Only her mouth moved this time, her words sliding into my ears without sound. “Just one game.”

I don’t entirely remember what happened next. Running, maybe. Screaming though I couldn’t hear myself over the collapsing rush of music spilling from the calliope, louder and faster like organs tearing themselves apart. The rides spun. The lights snapped on for just a second, flooding the whole midway in white heat. I remember their faces in that flash children no longer, but dried husks carved into carnival masks, wide eyes and painted grins. Their fingers reached for me, thin as wires, twitching like claws, pulling at the air between us.

I remember falling. And then waking.

Not at home. Not in my bed.

Here.

The calliope is still playing now. I’ve been writing this while it screams in the background, because I don’t know what else to do. I’ve tried leaving. Every path I take bends back to the main gates. Beyond the field, only darkness. I can’t find the town anymore. What’s out there isn’t roads or grass or sky it’s something else, some endless black canvas that doesn’t end.

The music doesn’t stop, not for a second. It’s playing outside this tent where I’m hiding, its notes shaking the canvas, pressing through the ground. Every time I close my eyes I feel the children drawing closer, circling. I hear their bare feet scuffing the gravel, hear them humming along with the tune.

I think I understand now. I shouldn’t have come alone. Carnival games are always meant for two or more. That’s all they want. That’s why the gates keep opening every few years when someone wanders too close. Games can’t exist without players. And the children they never stop. They just wait for someone new to stumble inside.

The girl is standing outside my tent now. I can see her shadow against the fabric. She’s smiling. I can feel it sharp against my skin. And her voice, even softer than before, seeps through the canvas:

“Your turn.”",loudscarytruestories,2025-09-30T17:15:37,Reddit
Rust,Subject 047: The Thing in the Mine | True Horror / Creepypasta,"I need to tell someone what happened down there. Maybe writing this out will help me make sense of it. Or maybe I just need to warn others.

My name is Jake. I'm a coal miner in Appalachia. Was a coal miner. I don't think I can ever go back underground again.

# The Beginning

Another 12-hour shift. My hands were bleeding through my gloves, my back screaming with every swing of the pickaxe. But I kept going. I always keep going. My daughter Sarah has leukemia. Stage 3. Her treatment costs $340 every two weeks. Insurance doesn't cover half of it.

So I dig. I bleed. I break my body in the darkness so she can live in the light.

That day started like any other. Hard hat, LED headlamp, pickaxe over my shoulder. Down into the coal-black tunnels, wooden support beams creaking overhead, coal dust coating everything.

*Strike. Strike. Strike.*

The rhythm of survival. Each hit is a dollar. Each dollar is a dose of medicine. Each dose is another day for Sarah.

# The Discovery

Then my pickaxe hit something that shouldn't exist.

*CLANG!*

Not stone. Not coal. *Metal.*

I brushed away the debris with my gloved hands. A steel door. Heavy, industrial, buried under years of rock and coal. Warning symbols were corroded away, but I could make out edges of text: ""...AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY..."" ""...BIOHAZARD...""

Nobody knew this was here. No records. No maps. This section of the mine was abandoned in the 1970s.

I should have reported it. Should have walked away. Should have let it stay buried.

But I was curious. And tired. And stupid.

The door groaned as I pulled it open. My LED beam barely penetrated the darkness beyond. Cold air rushed out – wrong air, stale and rotten.

I stepped through.

# The Laboratory

My headlamp revealed an underground facility that shouldn't exist. Concrete floors cracked and stained. Metal examination tables overturned, leather restraints torn apart. Broken glass vials everywhere – hundreds of them, scattered like fallen stars.

Medical equipment. Rusted IV stands. Surgical tools. Monitoring devices with shattered screens.

And cages.

Metal cages with bars bent outward from the *inside*. Deep claw marks scored into the walls. Restraints hanging loose, torn through.

Whatever was kept here... escaped.

On one wall, I found a faded document behind cracked glass:

**PROJECT RESURRECTION** **Subject 047 - Status: CRITICAL FAILURE** **Age: 8 years** **Procedure: Cellular regeneration via tissue grafting** **Notes: Subject shows signs of consciousness but extreme aggression. Recommend immediate termination.**

Eight years old.

They experimented on a *child*.

# The Sound

That's when I heard it. Scratching. Slow, deliberate. Coming from the far corner of the lab, beyond my light's reach.

My hands gripped the pickaxe tighter. My heart hammered against my ribs.

""Hello?"" My voice cracked. ""Someone there?""

The scratching stopped.

Then I heard breathing. Wet, labored, struggling.

My headlamp flickered – the battery dying at the worst possible moment. In the strobing light, I saw it:

A pale shape. Crouched. Elongated limbs folded at wrong angles.

*Flicker.*

Glowing red eyes.

*Flicker.*

Black stitching across yellowish skin.

*Flicker.*

Numbers carved into its chest: **047**

My headlamp steadied. And I saw Subject 047 in full.

# The Monster

It was humanoid. Six feet tall but skeletal, emaciated. Pale yellowish skin stretched over bones. Black surgical stitching crisscrossed its entire body – arms, legs, torso, face. Like someone had torn a person apart and sewn them back together wrong.

Its limbs were too long. Too thin. Clearly attached surgically, different skin tones at the joints where they'd been grafted on.

But the worst part? Its face.

It still looked like a child. A child's features stretched and distorted. Eyes that glowed red like burning embers, but underneath... I could see they were still *human* eyes. Scared. Confused. In pain.

It wore a tattered hospital gown – cream colored, stained, with ""047"" printed on the chest.

We stared at each other. Man and monster. Predator and prey. Father and... another victim of a cruel world.

# The Connection

It moved closer. Not attacking – *crawling*. Its elongated limbs moved with jerky, puppet-like motions. It reached one stitched hand toward me, and I saw its fingers trembling.

It tried to speak. Its mouth opened, vocal cords damaged by whatever they'd done, and only a rasping whisper emerged:

""...hurts...""

God. It was still in there. The child was still in there, trapped in this nightmare body.

I lowered my pickaxe. ""I'm sorry,"" I whispered. ""I'm so sorry for what they did to you.""

Its glowing red eyes flickered – and for just a moment, they looked normal. Brown. A child's eyes. It saw me. Really *saw* me.

And I saw my daughter in its suffering.

# The Change

Then its body convulsed. It doubled over, clutching its stomach. The red glow in its eyes intensified.

Hunger.

It had been trapped down here for *decades*. Alone. Starving. Waiting.

The connection we'd shared vanished. The human consciousness retreated behind primal need.

It looked at me differently now. Not as a person. As *food*.

""Wait—"" I started backing away. ""Wait, I can help—""

It lunged.

# The Chase

I ran. Boots pounding coal dust, LED beam bouncing wildly off tunnel walls. Behind me, the creature pursued with unnatural speed, its elongated limbs carrying it in a horrific crawl.

*Left tunnel. Right. Another left.*

The mine was a maze. I'd worked here for three years and still got lost sometimes. Now I was running blind, my headlamp dying, the creature's glowing red eyes visible in my peripheral vision.

*Gaining. It was gaining.*

I turned a corner and slammed into solid rock. Dead end. I'd taken a wrong turn.

I spun around just as it reached me.

# The End

It tackled me to the ground. My headlamp flew off, clattering across the tunnel floor, casting crazy shadows. The creature's face was inches from mine, its breath cold and wrong.

Those red eyes... they flickered again. Human. Monster. Human. Monster.

It was fighting itself. The hunger versus what little humanity remained.

I stopped struggling. My hands fell to my sides.

""It's okay,"" I whispered, and I meant it. ""It's okay.""

I thought of Sarah. My beautiful daughter. I'd been killing myself slowly in these mines to keep her alive. Working myself to death for medicine money.

Maybe... maybe this was just a faster way to do the same thing.

This creature – Subject 047 – it had been a child once too. Taken. Experimented on. Tortured. Left to suffer alone in the dark for decades.

If my death could end its pain, even for a moment...

""I understand,"" I told it. ""I'm a father too. I know what it's like to hurt for your child. To do anything to make their pain stop.""

Its red eyes dimmed. Tears – actual tears – streaked down its stitched face.

It was grateful. And sorry. And so, so tired.

My last thought before everything went dark was simple:

*At least my suffering fed another child.*

# Epilogue

They found my hard hat three days later. My pickaxe. My wedding ring in the tunnel.

They never found me.

They sealed that section of the mine. Said it was structurally unsound. Dangerous. Nobody goes down there now.

But sometimes, miners in nearby tunnels report strange sounds. Scratching. Breathing. Crying.

And once, just once, someone's headlamp caught something moving in the deep darkness. Something pale. Something stitched together. Something with glowing red eyes that looked almost... peaceful.

Subject 047 isn't hungry anymore.

But it's still down there.

Still waiting.

Still alone.

**If you're reading this and you work underground – in mines, in tunnels, in caves – please. Be careful. Not everything buried should be found.**

**And not every monster chose to become one.**

**\[End\]**

Rust,Subway Station — survivors know: the best loot’s underground… and so are the worst nightmares | Battlemap | 40x30,"Beneath the ruined city, the subway station lies broken and silent. Cracked platforms stretch between rusted rails, while dead escalators lead to entrances buried in debris. Shattered ticket booths, scorched bathrooms, and dark utility rooms offer both cover and danger. In the flicker of failing lights, raiders, ghouls, and worse wait in the shadows—every corner a gamble between scavenged survival and sudden death.

Rust,The Mystery of the PKR 2.85 Million Honda City: Why Buying a Used Car in Pakistan Is an Existential Crisis,"My Encounter with the $10,000 Time Capsule

I thought I was prepared for the chaos of Pakistan’s used car market, but then I stumbled upon the listing: a 2008 Honda City i-DSI Vario asking for a staggering PKR 2.85 million.
Let that number sink in. This is a 17-year-old car, being sold for nearly three times its original value. The seller’s justification, proudly listed on the ad? “First Owner” and, the Holy Grail of Pakistani car sales, “Genuine Paint.”
Intrigued, and slightly disturbed, I reached out. My offer was a generous PKR 2 million—still a high price for its age. The seller’s reaction wasn’t just a rejection; it was a digital sneer. He was genuinely offended, as if I had insulted his prized, appreciating asset. It was clear: the price was non-negotiable, fixed not by the car’s mechanical health, but by a superficial claim to its cosmetic history.
That interaction was a breaking point. It forced me to ask: What bizarre, upside-down logic governs used car pricing in this country?

The Bizarre Logic Behind Used Car Pricing (Where Up is Down)

The problem, as I quickly realised, runs far deeper than a single over-priced Honda. It’s a systemic delusion that warps the entire transaction.

1.	The Paint Job Doesn’t Make the Engine Go “Vroom”

Let’s address the obsession. In Pakistan, the paint condition is disproportionately valued. A car with “genuine paint”—meaning it has never been repainted—commands an instant, significant premium.
Why? Because any repaint is immediately flagged by buyers as evidence of a major accident, regardless of how minor the damage actually was. This creates a market where sellers prioritize the superficial over the mechanical. The car’s engine could be sputtering its last breath, the transmission could be slipping into oblivion, and the suspension could be shot—but if the original coat of factory paint is intact, the price is artificially inflated.
We are, essentially, collectively misled. We pay a premium for a shiny veneer while ignoring the vital, expensive components that actually determine a car’s longevity and performance.

2.	We Treat Cars as Assets, Not Liabilities

This is the real kicker. In a functioning economy, a car is a depreciating asset—it loses value the second you drive it off the lot. In Pakistan, cars are often treated as a legitimate financial investment.
This flawed mindset is driven by two things: a limited supply of new cars (thanks to high tariffs and low local production), and massive currency depreciation. People buy a car, believing it’s a safe place to park their money, expecting it to at least hold its value, if not appreciate.
This self-fulfilling prophecy means sellers feel justified in setting absurd prices. If a 17-year-old car is being sold for nearly three times its original cost, it’s not because of inflation; it’s because the entire market is gripped by the delusion that a used car is a better investment than the bank.

3.	The Dangerous Game of “Buyer Beware”

The underlying tragedy is the sheer lack of transparency. When a car is sold, the buyer has almost nothing to rely on besides the seller’s assurance that the car is “fine.”
There is no mandated, objective pre-sale inspection. A seller has zero incentive to disclose a costly problem like a failing head gasket or a shot gearbox. Why would they pay for a professional check that would only force them to lower their price? Buyers, lacking technical expertise, are forced to trust a seller looking to maximize profit, inevitably leading to people overpaying for cars that are far from “genuine” under the hood.

The Fix: How to Bring Sanity Back to the Dealership

After witnessing how completely broken the system is, the solution isn’t more negotiation; it’s systemic transparency and regulation. Here’s what needs to happen to level the playing field and stop the financial madness:

1.	A Government-Authorized Vehicle Inspection: The Mandatory Check-Up

The first, non-negotiable step is a standardized, government-mandated inspection for every used car listed for sale. This must go beyond basic registration renewal. The focus must be on mechanical health:

 * Engine &amp; Drivetrain: Performance, leakage, and overall mechanical condition.

 * Safety &amp; Structure: Suspension, brakes, tires, chassis integrity, and alignment.

 * Electronics &amp; Interior: Functionality of all dashboard components, climate control, and safety features.

 * Body Condition: Documenting dents, rust, and paintwork (but rating it realistically).

These inspections must be conducted at official, independent government-run or accredited facilities to prevent bias and corruption.

2.	A Standardized Vehicle Health Report and Rating System

Once inspected, the vehicle must be assigned a clear, comprehensive, and publicly available report card. This report would grade key components like, grade and detailed against each parameter.
Buyers could access this report instantly online via the car’s registration number. This single document would shift the power dynamic: the value would be based on facts, not seller anecdotes.

3.	Fair Pricing Tied to Objective Condition

With a standardized health report, an independent body (or the government itself) could establish a transparent price range for each car model based on its test results.
This would fundamentally break the “Genuine Paint” market manipulation. A car with perfect paint but a failing engine would be priced lower than a car with a few repainted panels but an engine in ‘Excellent’ condition. It would force sellers to invest in maintenance, not just cosmetics, and reward buyers with fair pricing.

4.	Cost Sharing for Transparency

The fee for this vital inspection must be reasonable (PKR 3,000–5,000) and structured to promote participation. The seller could pay the fee upfront to demonstrate confidence in their car’s condition, or the cost could be split between the buyer and seller upon transaction. Either way, the small cost of the inspection would be negligible compared to the thousands wasted on an unknown, faulty vehicle.

Conclusion: Time to Treat a Car Like a Car

The current used car market in Pakistan is a financial mess—defined by inflated prices, systemic lack of transparency, and a deeply flawed belief that a 17-year-old sedan is a sound investment.
By implementing a mandatory, standardized vehicle testing system and linking pricing to objective mechanical health, the government can finally introduce fairness and sanity. It’s time to stop paying fortunes for superficial bragging rights and start paying a fair price for a reliable vehicle. The market needs to change, and the key is simply making every sale transparent.

Rust,"Rondo Ruut ST2 frameset – worth upgrading? Questions about weight, workmanship, and coating","Hi everyone,

I’m looking at the **Rondo Ruut ST2**, which is currently on sale for around €1,100. My idea would be to buy it as a complete bike and then upgrade it (e.g. Rival 1x12, Zipp 303).

Before I jump in, I’d like to ask specifically about the **frame itself**:

* Do you think this frame is worth upgrading, or should I just go for a higher-end steel frameset from the start?
* How does the **weight** of the Ruut ST2 frame + fork compare to other steel frames (e.g. Columbus, Dedacciai, etc.)?
* What’s your impression of the **workmanship** (welds, finishing, alignment)?
* Is the frame **ED coated** inside for rust protection, or is it just paint?

Thanks a lot for any first-hand experiences or insights!

Rust,"Telelog, a native Rust diagnostic library that generates execution flowcharts and also has first-class Python bindings.","https://preview.redd.it/bxo51zjq9asf1.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2eaeb7b905c01d694f35f8d7cc16292b3eabda85

Hey r/rust,

I built **Telelog**, a high-performance instrumentation library written in pure Rust, to help developers visualize their code's execution flow.

Instead of just reading text logs to understand program flow, Telelog generates **Mermaid.js diagrams** (like flowcharts and timelines) directly from your running code. It's designed for minimal overhead and provides an intuitive way to debug complex logic.

The core Rust crate offers:

* A simple API to **track components** and **profile code blocks**.
* The ability to generate **visual execution graphs** automatically.
* The performance and safety guarantees of Rust.

To make it accessible to a wider audience, I also used PyO3 to create a seamless Python wrapper. Now, developers in both ecosystems can get the full benefit of a native Rust core.

The project is fully open-source. I'd love to get your feedback, especially on the Rust API.

Rust,Is Rust the Beast for making mobile application that use 3D models and AI-Generation? (vs. C++),"Even though I've already seen a lot of hateful and unfavorable comments about Rust on YouTube, I still want to hear directly from the rust devs.  
I want to create a mobile application that makes use of 3D models and AI generation. Essentially, imagine using Blender on your phones (but not to the same extent as Blender).  
As you can see, I require quicker runtimes for machine learning models, effective 3D model generation, memory management, speed, backend, and security.  
I therefore researched and discovered that C++ and Rust are the two winning languages.  
Could someone please examine Rust's performance in the AI-ML and 3D model departments?  ",rust,2025-09-30T16:21:37,Reddit
Rust,new here! just wanted to show some progress pics,"hey all! wanted to show some progress on my legion kit that my wife and I purchased years ago, but never got around to painting everything until recently. the ships and buildings (obviously) are all printed, but the AT-ST and bikes were purchased. all that's left to finish are 2 buildings (i know one of them is not accurate to the location) and the bomber, then just need to find a good gaming mat to fit everything. everything is mostly airbrushed for the primers/base colors, then hand paints, rust powders and washes. used a cheap amazon airbrush and they actually are pretty good workhorses. was especially happy how the rancor and dewback turned out for my first attempt.

we have still yet to learn the gameplay, but I've watched several videos. there's a local brewery here that does paint and sips so we may try to finish the remainder at one of their events next week.",SWlegion,2025-09-30T16:15:29,Reddit

Rust,Finished first mini / need advice for further painting,"A friend of mine bought me a warhammer krieg set, thinking it was already assembled and painted (was not). It was sitting on my desk for months and now i decided to finally engage it. I bought a starter set and painted the included test mini, it was more fun than i expected and it looks much better than expected (never painted/drawed before)

[test mini](https://preview.redd.it/3ky5uwxr5asf1.png?width=1855&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e27e13ca7783bdb52f7f59c4c801b5f758c72dc)

  
Now I want to paint the krieg set but I have some problems/questions:

  
1. I only have the colours included in [this set](https://thearmypainter.com/de-de/products/warpaints-fanatic-warpaints-fanatic-starter-set-wp8066p). I'm aiming for a style like this and want to mix the ultramarine blue  with the primer grey for the coat and the silver metal with black for armor. For the leaher i wanted to use the base leather colour and mix a bit of white for the gas mask/backpack. For the rust i wanted to water down my brown and use it like a wash: Is this possible or should I just buy the right colours directly?

[colour set I'm aiming for](https://preview.redd.it/ze2nwpep3asf1.png?width=372&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=526f2b018726d0bf495b9c26e1f3a1703889b775)

2. Because I had so much fun and I will definitely continue painting after the set, I thought about buying more paint. I don't know whats next and if I want to stick with one setting/game/style so i thought about purchasing a set [like this](https://thearmypainter.com/de-de/products/warpaints-fanatic-warpaints-fanatic-most-wanted-set-combo-wp8071c?_pos=6&amp;_fid=14f9ad694&amp;_ss=c), but i also stumbled upon speedpaints. Would it be better to just take the speedpaints to get more for the money or I should i rather avoid it. (I watched some videos about it and it sounded really cool for beginners)

  
PS: I just included the webside links of the sets i bought, i don't want to entice people to buy these products/from these firms, its just to give some info.",minipainting,2025-09-30T16:08:00,Reddit
