Java,"Odisha gears up for holy Kartika month: A time of faith, fasting and devotion","As the auspicious month of Kartika draws near, Odisha readies itself for a period of deep spirituality, ritual observance, and cultural vibrancy. Known as the holiest month in the Hindu calendar, Kartika is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva, and holds immense significance for devotees who observe strict religious vows, charity, and fasting during this sacred time.From temples adorned with lights to river ghats filled with the fragrance of incense and chants, the entire state transforms into a devotional landscape. For many Odias, Kartika is not merely a religious observance, it is a way of life that symbolises purity, faith, and the triumph of devotion over indulgence.When The Holy Month Begins...The month of Kartika usually falls between October and November, beginning the day after Laxmi Puja and concluding with Kartika Purnima, the full moon day. According to the Hindu calendar, it is considered the most auspicious month for worshipping Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva.Devotees across Odisha adopt a vegetarian lifestyle during this period, refraining from non-vegetarian food. Many also opt out onions and garlic during the sacred month. Many people also undertake vows of celibacy and austerity, dedicating their days to prayer, cleanliness, and charity.Religious Significance And RitualsKartika is often described as the month of penance and devotion. Each Monday during this month holds special significance for devotees of Lord Shiva, who observe fasts and offer prayers at temples, especially the Lingaraj Temple in Bhubaneswar and Loknath Temple in Puri and Dhabaleswar in Cuttack.For Vaishnavites, the month is equally sacred as it honours Lord Vishnu. Temples like Jagannath Temple in Puri and Ananta Vasudeva Temple witness a surge of devotees during this time.Habisyalis: The Devout Widows Of KartikaOne of the most striking features of the Kartika observance in Odisha is the presence of Habisyalis, widowed women, who travel from across the state to Puri to lead a life of spiritual discipline for an entire month.They follow a strict routine, eating only once a day, a simple meal known as Habisa Anna, prepared without spices. They spend their days in prayer, visiting temples, and taking holy dips in sacred tanks like Narendra Pushkarini, Swetaganga, and Markandeya Pokhari.The Puri district administration and police make special arrangements every year for their accommodation and safety, with designated lodging centres and round-the-clock security.Also Read: Devotees to get free ‘Mahaprasad’ at Puri Jagannath temple soon: Odisha Law MinisterKartika Purnima: The Grand ConclusionThe holy month culminates with Kartika Purnima, the full moon day considered the most auspicious of all. On this day, devotees take early morning baths in rivers, ponds, or the sea and offer diyas (lamps) to the holy waters, symbolizing the triumph of light over darkness.The sight of tiny boats made of banana bark or paper, carrying lamps, flowers, and betel leaves, floating on the rivers and ponds at dawn is one of Odisha’s most beautiful spiritual spectacles.Bali Yatra: Remembering Odisha’s Maritime GloryKartika Purnima also marks the beginning of the famous Bali Yatra, celebrated in Cuttack. The festival commemorates the ancient maritime legacy of Odisha’s Sadhabas, traders and sailors, who once sailed to Southeast Asian countries like Bali, Java, and Sumatra for trade and cultural exchange.People float symbolic paper boats in memory of those voyages while the Bali Yatra fair, one of Asia’s largest open-air trade fair, lights up Cuttack city with cultural performances, food stalls, and traditional crafts.Also Read: Odisha’s ‘Bali Yatra’ to make historic debut in British Parliament this NovemberA Month of Faith and ReflectionKartika month, often called the ‘month of salvation’, blends faith, simplicity, and community spirit. Whether it’s the solemn discipline of the Habisyalis, the devotion of Monday fasts, or the joyous floating of boats on Kartika Purnima, the observance reflects Odisha’s enduring connection between spiritual devotion and cultural identity.As the lamps drift away on the water, they carry with them prayers for peace, purity, and prosperity, marking the end of one of Odisha’s most sacred and soul-stirring months.",odishatv,2025-10-05T05:18:08,NewsData

Server is running on Minecraft 1.21.8 Fabric with only few mods for QoL purposes and terrain/structures revamp. Main mods include:  
*- In-game voice chat*  
*- Land Claiming for worry-free building*  
*- In-game chat integrated with Discord*  
*- Revamped Nether/End/villages/structures/strongholds/mansions/temples etc.*  
*- Falling Tree to one-shot the entire tree when cutting.*

Depending on players' demands we can add more mods.

Nether opened Wednesday 1st October and End opened Saturday 4th October.

Main server concept is to be a chill and welcoming environment.

So either you wanna just chill and build alone or with others, or wanna speed run you are most welcome.

Java,"Stuck in ETL Support, I want to switch into Spring Boot Dev","

I joined XYZ Company for a telecom product as an ETL Prod Support (Java + SQL) guy. Been here for 2 years and 3 months now.
Most of my day goes into debugging old code, fixing minor snippets, and babysitting production issues. That’s it.

No new dev work.
No cloud.
No pipelines.
Just logs, logs, and more logs. 

Company’s already gone through multiple layoffs, and I’m still hanging on (remote job tho, so can’t complain too much).

But man… I feel stuck.
I’ve been learning Spring Boot, doing DSA + LLD prep, and even building a personal eCommerce project to get actual hands-on dev skills.

Now the big question —
Should I show my experience as ETL dev, or tweak my résumé and show it as Spring Boot dev experience to get interviews?

I know faking’s risky, but the market’s wild right now and nobody wants “ETL support” profiles.

Would really appreciate some honest takes from people who’ve switched stacks or survived this phase.
Help a fellow dev out 🙏

Java,Stonehaven SMP {Vanilla} {QoL Mods} {Protected Builds} {Java 1.21.8}},"Hey everyone.

I have hosted my server publicly this Monday 29th September (fresh start) and have gathered a few ppl from Reddit as well who each play on their own pace and all are friendly. Activity on server varies though depending on time zones.

Server is running on Minecraft 1.21.8 Fabric with only few mods for QoL purposes and terrain/structures revamp. Main mods include:  
*- In-game voice chat*  
*- Land Claiming for worry-free building*  
*- In-game chat integrated with Discord*  
*- Revamped Nether/End/villages/structures/strongholds/mansions/temples etc.*  
*- Falling Tree to one-shot the entire tree when cutting.*

Depending on players' demands we can add more mods.

Nether opened Wednesday 1st October and End opened Saturday 4th October.

Main server concept is to be a chill and welcoming environment.

So either you wanna just chill and build alone or with others, or wanna speed run you are most welcome.

Go,"Bronny James has a rough shooting night, but makes progress in his quest to earn a role with Lakers","PALM DESERT, California — Three days shy of a year after Bronny James made his preseason debut with the Los Angeles Lakers in this desert arena, the NBA’s most famous son resumed his quest to show he belongs in the big leagues.While his 1-for-12 shooting performance in the Lakers' opener wasn’t ideal, James felt his effort Friday night was another step forward in a process that’s already showing results to coach JJ Redick.Bronny James scored eight points while LeBron James and Luka Doncic sat out of the Lakers’ 103-81 loss to the Phoenix Suns.Bronny's 40-year-old father is progressing deliberately in his return from a minor nerve injury to begin his record 23rd NBA season, while Doncic is also ramping up with caution after his busy summer playing for Slovenia at EuroBasket.That left plenty of playing time in the Coachella Valley for depth players like Bronny James, who hit a 3-pointer late in the third quarter for his only field goal. He missed his other seven 3-point attempts while struggling for buckets alongside fellow 2024 draft pick Dalton Knecht, who was 2 for 10 with 1-for-7 shooting from distance.“I felt like they were pretty good shots,” said Bronny James, who turns 21 years old on Monday. “Not rushed, not forcing anything. Didn’t have my legs under me as much as I wanted to, so a lot of them were short, but most of them were on line. I felt like I could have made those. I felt like I took some good shots.”Bronny's confidence was undiminished by those misses after the Lakers opened their preseason in the same arena where Bronny James first played alongside his famous father in October 2024.The Palm Springs-area fans who rumbled with anticipation whenever Bronny touched the ball a year ago didn’t react much this time around. The novelty of Bronny’s presence has faded while he continues to grow into something much more than a sideshow.Bronny was in the Lakers’ first substitution group, and he played nearly 23 minutes. He gave a consistent defensive effort with intermittent effectiveness as he works to become the impact defender that Redick believes he can become with more growth.“Definitely felt like I was more comfortable, especially with the ball in my hands, and with the defensive and offensive schemes,” Bronny said. “But I’m just trying to feel it out. Feeling my way still and just continuing to grow.”Bronny appeared in 27 games for the Lakers during his rookie season, even making basketball history by playing alongside his father in the opener. But he accomplished much of his growth in the G League, where he averaged 21.9 points and 5.5 assists for the Lakers’ affiliate.After a summer of hard work, Bronny is demonstrating progress to Redick.“He is so much more comfortable and confident as a player,” Redick said of Bronny. “Skill-wise, read-wise, all of those things have improved, but there’s a big difference between improving those things in individual workouts and small group settings, and doing it 5-on-5.... He’s a totally different player than he was a year ago. I thought the stuff that he did down in the G League last year was huge for him in developing a comfort level in playing at this level.”Austin Reaves scored 20 points to lead the Lakers’ starters, which included newcomers Deandre Ayton and Jake LaRavia with Rui Hachimura and Jarred Vanderbilt.Bronny James wasn't the only Lakers player trying to stand out on defense. Ayton had eight rebounds and just one point while taking only two shots in 18 minutes, but he also blocked two shots while demonstrating his commitment to protecting the rim.The Lakers’ preseason continues Sunday against the Golden State Warriors. Redick said Doncic also will sit out that game in San Francisco, as will LeBron James.That means Bronny James will have more chances, and he remains determined to seize them.“I’m just trying to feel it out, trying to get some reps in with the guys,” Bronny said. “There’s probably not going to be as many opportunities during the season, so I’m just coming out and defending hard, playing my game, doing the non-negotiables. So if JJ sees that, maybe he’ll give me an opportunity.”",manilatimes,2025-10-05T06:43:30,NewsData

Go,Late Night Talks,"We had our chance to speak last night.

It didn’t go how either of us wanted to.

On my end, I was still holding out some hope in you as a person. I think you thought you handled it well, but really you reacted just as I thought you would. Rather than angry or anything, it just makes me sad for you. 

All your relationships are going to and up the same way. Friendships, too, until it clicks. 

I’m still holding out for a little hope, but I think you’re going to protect yourself (and in the end, hurt yourself) by thinking I took things way out of context. 

You’re probably trying to remember all the things you said, and going “I didn’t mean it that way” or “what did I say??!”

The thing is though, our conversation last night just proved to me I didn’t take it out of context at all. You were hypocritical, avoidant, and manipulative. I think (or I’d like to) that you just don’t realize what you’re doing-that you had to be like that growing up to protect yourself and your brother and it’s all you know. That you’re just trying to protect yourself by throwing out anything you think will work, and each time you do you convince yourself of of what you’re saying, too. 

And I said (and believe) whole heartedly that I think you do actually care, and that’s what makes this whole thing so sad.

I’ll still be your friend, because I think friendship is one of the most important things in our lives and I think you need that kind of love, support, and challenge in your life more than anything. It will also be easier to distance myself when I need to.

I truly wish you the best, and that you can find the healing you need.

Go,30 [F4M] #SoCal - submissive babygirl looking for older Daddy Dom to teach her all about the fun she’s missed out on,"Hi there

I’m looking for a dominant man at least 5’9 (I’m 5’8) and 35 years old (I like older men) who lives in SoCal, specifically Orange County. I’m not looking for hook ups, one night stands, or a friends with benefits situation. I’m looking for a real in person BDSM Dom/sub dynamic within a long term committed relationship.

Early last year, I got out of a decade long mostly vanilla relationship and am trying to find myself in all the chaos. I’m here to meet new people, have some kinky fun, and try to move on with my life!

A bit about me:
- Hobbies/interests include Disney, literature, board games, theater, baking, animals, museums, nature walks (not hiking, I’m not athletic), and staying home and being lazy
- In order for me to enjoy sex, my mind must be seduced first so I enjoy getting to know people on here for a short time before meeting in person. Also, please be okay with not immediately going behind closed doors together and fucking right when we meet. That’s not my styl. At least buy me a drink first ;)
- I’m plus size, kind of tall at 5’8, have brown hair and blue eyes, and I’ve been told a very innocent looking face
- The physical “type” I’m most attracted to is over 35 years old, big, tall, and beardy. I’m sorry but just how not everyone is attracted to plus size bodies, I’m not attracted to slim or extremely fit bodies. So middle aged burly dudes to the front please!
- I’m looking for someone SINGLE as I want to keep the possibility of a long term romantic relationship. I am NOT just looking for sex with no strings attached or a friend with benefits. I’m looking for a real relationship with a Dom/sub dynamic
- Vaccinated, liberal, 420 friendly and looking for the same!

The NTG35 1800k is intriguing even though I am not sure I will like something that warm (but I said that about 3500, 2700, and rosy emitters all before), but my biggest concern is how much lower the output is lumen wise. 

Is it worth it to use this emitters in a D3AA or would it be better to go with a D4K (or even D4V2) to get the fourth emitter to make up for the roughly 30% less lumens? ",Hanklights,2025-10-06T00:08:38,Reddit
Go,Could Bupropion work for me?,"Hi all, recently diagnosed ADHD'er here (23M). I've been running the gauntlet of ADHD meds and I think stimulants just aren't for me, as I've had adverse reactions to both Vyvanse and Adderall (anxiety, severe heart racing, fatigue during exercise, etc.). I'm likely going to meet with my doctor next week to discuss non-stimulant options. I've looked into what is available and honestly bupropion seems to be the best fit based on my non-medical judgement. I have struggled with chronic fatigue, brain fog, and poor motivation since my teen years. This is something I had no idea was related to ADHD, but after being diagnosed, I was informed this is common in adults who go undiagnosed, and it can be treated with the right medication. I've read that Wellbutrin/Buproprion can be extremely helpful for these symptoms, but I do have a few reservations given the side effects I've had on other drugs. So, I have a few questions for the community:

1)If you, like me, had adverse anxiety/heart symptoms on stimulants, did you also experience this on Wellbutrin. If so, did it go away eventually? 

2) How much does it really help with your ADHD symptoms, like deficits in focus and attention?

3) Are there any sexual side effects? I know from past experience I am sensitive to the sexual side effects on SSRIs. Though I know this isn't as much of a concern for Bupropion, I'm still somewhat worried.",bupropion,2025-10-06T00:08:38,Reddit

Go,He ghosted me after saying he'd come to an event... after we'd been getting close,"There’s this guy in my class I’d been talking to a lot. We’ve hung out outside of school, joked around, and always had fun — I really thought there was a connection. We’d look for each other in class, talk about music, laugh — it just felt natural.

I invited him to a school event, and he said he’d go. I was excited, but when the day came, he completely ghosted me — no text, no explanation. I even saw him walking with his friends, which hurt.

I called him because I was frustrated, and he acted confused like he didn’t know what I was talking about. I knew his friends were around, so it felt like he was pretending not to care. I told him he didn’t have to say yes if he didn’t want to go, and how rude it was, then hung up.

He never apologized, but now he’s suddenly everywhere — walking past my classes, going out of his way to walk near me, pretending not to notice but obviously paying attention. He doesn’t joke or dance like he used to, not even with anyone else.

It’s like all that energy was just for me.

He’s also started talking to random girls, and I’m pretty sure it’s just to get my attention. But when I ignore it and hang out with my friends, he immediately stops talking to them.

I haven’t been friendly — not rude, just distant. I’m avoiding him to see if he’s genuinely sorry. When I’m quiet, he’s fine, but when I’m laughing with my friends, he gets tense and quiet. It’s like he wants me to notice him while acting like he doesn’t care.

He used to mirror me — my texts, my mannerisms, even made a necklace similar to my pop tab bracelet. Sometimes he’d get jealous or competitive, like he didn’t know how to deal with liking someone.

Ever since that call, he’s been totally different — no jokes, no excitement, just distant.

I don’t know if he’s genuinely sorry, playing games, or just confused about his feelings. How should I handle this? Should I confront him, keep my distance, or just move on?

Go,Definition of Master Set or Complete Set,"Hey everyone!

So, I've been in Pokemon collecting again since mid-XY era. Something that I've personally seen different ideas on is the definition of a ""master set"" or ""complete set"".

For me, I've always considered the two as separate things.

A ""complete set"" has been one of every card that can be pulled from the set. So all of the base cards (either regular/holo or reverse holo) and then the full arts, IRs, SIRs, etc. If you can go from the first card to the last card in the set without skipping anything, then it's a complete set.

A ""master set"" has been one of every card that can be pulled from the set, but (sorta) doubled. Essentially, a full complete set of the regular/holo, full arts, IRs, etc, and then a full set of the same cards that have a reverse holo variant. And in a case like Prismatic Evolutions or White Flare and Black Bolt, this would also include getting all of the Poke Ball and Master Ball variants present. This doesn't include promo variants of the cards, at least not at this time.

I'm collecting my definition of Master sets for every set, along with a personal side collection

What kinds of definitions do you have for this? Do you collect any full sets? How do you have them organized?",PokemonTCG,2025-10-06T00:08:31,Reddit

For now I printed out some tenor banjo tabs and have been practicing those but I have no idea how to hold my fingers or what things to practice specifically.

Go,Why seek advice on the Internet anymore?,"Has anyone else noticed this is the default response whenever someone has a healthcare concern about their cat? Doesn't that just go without saying? I mean, OBVIOUSLY, if a pet is unwell, the best option is to go to a professional. But doesn't that just negate the whole point of these forums? 
If someone wants to know, for instance, if it's a good idea to try to disinect a wound with, say, alcohol. And they post the inquiry on reddit or whatever. What they're probably looking for is an answer to their question. Not ""call your vet"".

Not everyone has a lot of money. For instance when I brought my cat in because he was scratching his ear too much and causing abrasions. I brought him in, and even though it was a simple fix, something I could have done on my own, it cost almost 200 dollars. To me, a public school teacher, that's a LOT of money! 
Not everyone can afford to bring their pet to the vet for any concerns they may have. That's the whole point of forums like this. It gives you insight and your get anecdotal information that can guide your decision.

But when someone simply says ""you should contact your vet"", how is that helping AT ALL??  OBVIOUSLY the best option would be to bring your pet in. EVERYONE knows that. But if they're making a thread on social media about it, don't you think maybe there's a reason they're going to the internet for answers as opposed to bringing the pet in and getting charged 200 dollars for something you could have done on your own?

Python,What Are the Best Tools for Forecasting the Future?,"From Crystal Balls to Data Models: The Smartest Ways We Peer Ahead

Forecasting the future is both an art and a science. Whether you’re a business strategist, a policy maker, or simply planning your personal goals, knowing how to peer around the corner gives you a powerful edge. In this post, we break down the best tools for forecasting the future—from traditional trend analysis to cutting-edge AI models. This guide will help you understand which forecasting tools are worth your time and how to use them effectively. (Main keyword: forecasting tools)

Why Forecasting Matters More Than Ever

Forecasting tools help individuals and organizations make better decisions in the face of uncertainty. With data flowing in from every direction and change happening at breakneck speed, reliable forecasting is no longer optional—it’s strategic.

Whether you’re predicting sales, assessing climate impacts, or planning urban growth, the right forecasting method can:

Clarify potential futures
Reduce risk and uncertainty
Guide strategic choices
Inform resource allocation
In a volatile world, forecasting is your compass.

The Top Forecasting Tools (and When to Use Them)

Here are some of the most widely used and reliable tools for forecasting the future:

1. Trend Analysis

Best for: Identifying historical patterns to project future outcomes
Example Tools: Google Trends, market research reports
When to Use: Early-stage planning, marketing, retail strategy
Trend analysis is like reading tree rings—the past leaves clues. By observing patterns in consumer behavior, product lifecycles, or economic shifts, we can extrapolate likely future outcomes.

2. Time Series Models (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing)

Best for: Quantitative forecasting based on historical numerical data
Example Tools: R, Python (statsmodels), Excel
When to Use: Forecasting revenue, demand, or inventory
These models rely on historical data to detect seasonality, trends, and cyclic patterns. Think of them as statistical microscopes tuned to time.

3. Scenario Planning

Best for: Exploring multiple possible futures based on key uncertainties
Example Tools: Shell Scenario Planning Framework, Futures Wheel
When to Use: Strategic planning, geopolitical risk, innovation forecasting
Scenario planning doesn’t predict the future—it prepares you for several plausible ones. It’s especially useful when the future is shaped by unpredictable variables, like regulation or social change.

4. Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning

Best for: Complex, high-volume data-driven forecasts
Example Tools: TensorFlow, Prophet by Meta, AWS Forecast
When to Use: Personalization engines, financial markets, predictive maintenance
These AI-powered models can detect hidden patterns in vast data sets. They’re great for systems where data volume or complexity overwhelms traditional methods.

Real-World Example: Forecasting Retail Demand

A global apparel company used time series models and Google Trends to predict demand across 40 markets. They layered in machine learning models to detect new patterns post-COVID. As a result, they reduced overstock by 30% and improved revenue predictability.

This mix-and-match approach shows how combining tools gives better foresight.

Summary: Choose the Right Tool for the Forecast

Forecasting is not about having one magic tool—it’s about selecting the right one for the job. Trend analysis, statistical models, scenario planning, and AI each have their place. Use them wisely, and you’ll move from guessing to guiding.

📚Bookmarked for You

To dive deeper into forecasting and future thinking, here are three essential reads:

The Art of the Long View by Peter Schwartz — A classic on scenario planning from a Shell strategist.

Superforecasting by Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner — A deep dive into what makes some forecasters consistently more accurate.

Prediction Machines by Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, and Avi Goldfarb — Explores how AI is reshaping decision-making and forecasting.

🧬QuestionStrings to Practice

QuestionStrings are deliberately ordered sequences of questions in which each answer fuels the next, creating a compounding ladder of insight that drives progressively deeper understanding. What to do now (understand your assumptions):

🔍 Calibration String
For aligning assumptions with data:

“What trend am I assuming here?” →

“How recent is that data?” →

“What would make that trend reverse?”

Try weaving this into forecasting discussions. It’ll help you spot blind spots and build better models.

Forecasting isn’t about certainties; it’s about building the clearest lens possible to see ahead. The better your tools, the sharper your vision.",QuestionClass,2025-10-06T00:01:23,Reddit

Python,Breaking into Quant,"What’s up everyone. This might come off random but I am just thinking out loud at this point and wanted to hear from anyone in the quant world. I have a passion for technology and I recently have become very interested in Quant. 

I am 31 and I live in Cali. have no professional experience in quant for I have just started diving deep with theory and concepts. I have some experience with Python but in the grand scheme of things I know I am a novice. I want to make this a career for myself and make a change. I know I truly am late to the game but I am someone who has passion and truly will do anything I can to grow and learn everything I can to know the deep knowledge of quant. I want to mainly make my way into being a Quant Trader. 

I am currently doing self studies. Statistics, probability. Books. Hands on application with python and trying to get an idea of the space. My main reality is I know I’m getting older, or “old” in the space of quant. But to be real, I am changing careers no matter what so this is what I want to do. I keep seeing degrees are an absolute must. I have only gone to college for 3 semesters and majored in Kinesiology so, completely different. 

Forgive me for babbling on but I want to know if it’s essentially too late. I know things aren’t always as black and white. Successful alphas. Being able to convey what I have learned and continuing to grow, I want to compete. 

My main ask is do you think I am able to break into the space at the age of 34 ish after I receive a bachelors. Or if a bachelors is truly needed to be with a larger firm or even a smaller firm. I know the filters, the doing self studies path and even while applying to jobs you are immediately rejected due to the lack of a degree for the hr filters.

Could I learn and grow on my own and learn the ins and out of the trade and truly understand the math behind these decisions. Of course I am leaning towards self studies but I know this isn’t like cybersecurity (which I have less than 6 months experience in) where you can get a cert and employers know you know the standard for security. But with quant it’s a different animal. 

Long story short, would the best route to get a bachelors in computer science and then continue or is it even possible for me to prove alpha and studies and knowledge to where I can start growing on my own and still get hired by providing proof of knowledge with projects and anything else that I need. Thanks for all your help in advance, I know it’s a lengthy entry. I appreciate all of you, thank you! ",quantfinance,2025-10-05T23:48:46,Reddit

Python,I built an AI with an AI - and it actually works. Here's how it went!,"Tldr: I used [Zo](https://www.zo.computer/) (using 4.5 sonnet as the LLM backend) to build an implementation of the [LIDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIDA_(cognitive_architecture)) cognitive architecture as an end-to-end stress test, and it was the first LLM tool I've seen deliver a complete and working implementation. Here's the repo to [prove](https://github.com/mindpixel20/lida) it!

Long version: A few days ago, I came across [zo.computer](http://zo.computer/) and wanted to give it a try - what stood out to me was that it comes with a full-fledged linux VPS you've got total control over, in addition to workflows similar to Claude Pro. Naturally I wanted to use 4.5 Sonnet since it's always been my go-to for heavy coding work (there's a working FLOW-MATIC interpreter on my github I built with Claude btw). I like to run big coding projects to judge the quality of the tool and quickly find its limitations. Claude on its own, for instance, wasn't able to build up [Ikon Flux](http://cadia.ru.is/wiki/_media/public:publications:ikonfluxrutrcs07006.pdf) (another cognitive architecture) - it kept getting stuck in abstract concepts like saliences/pregnance in IF context. I figured LIDA would've been a reasonable but still large codebase to tackle with Zo + 4.5 sonnet.

The workflow itself was pretty interesting. After I got set up, I told Zo to research what LIDA was. Web search and browse tools were already built in, so it had no trouble getting up to speed. What I think worked best was prompting it to list out step by step what it'll need to do, and make a file with its ""big picture"" plan. After we got the plan down, I told it ""Okay, start at step 1, begin full implementation"" and off it went. It used the VM heavily to get a python environment up and running, organize the codebase's structure, and it even wrote out tests to verify each step was completed and functions as it should. Sometimes it'd struggle on code that didn't have an immediate fix; but telling it to consider alternatives usually got it back on track. It'd also stop and have me run the development stage's code on the VM to see for myself that it was working, which was neat!

So, for the next four or five-ish hours, this was the development loop. It felt much more collaborative than the other tools I've used so far, and honestly due to built-in file management AND a VM both me and Zo/Claude could use, it felt MUCH more productive. Less human error, more context for the LLM to work with, etc. Believe it or not, all of this was accomplished from a single Zo chat too.

Python,How to help cc understand private library APIs without bloating the context window?,"Hey r/ClaudeAI 

I'm integrating cc into my dev workflow and running into a common bottleneck: how to give it accurate context for private libraries (in separate git repos) my app depends on (custom classes, async patterns, internal helpers, etc.).

Feeding the full codebase of all private libraries into prompts isn't realistic - it quickly blows past token limits, and cc starts hallucinating once context gets fuzzy.

What I've tried so far:

- Pasting snippets + doc comments: Works for small cases, but scales horribly - messy and eats up tokens fast. 
- Linking a Markdown summary: Often ignored or inconsistently used.
- Prompt boilerplates: Fine for basic functions, but breaks down for complex APIs and async workflows. 

What I actually need: A low-token, lightweight method for cc to reliably recall the correct methods, parameters, and edge cases (e.g. `LibraryClient.authenticate_with_retry()`) without hallucinating or guessing.

Ideas I'm exploring:
- RAG / local vector store 
- JSON “cheat sheet” with key methods
- Local MCP servers for API metadata 

How are you managing private library APIs with cc? What's working for you in terms of tools, prompt design, or local context injection - ideally setups that run offline and don't require a GPU? 

would love to hear real-world experiences or lightweight solutions you've built.

btw. I am working with Python, TypeScript, Java and Dart

JavaScript,Suggestion for courses for Algorithms &amp; Competitive Programming,"For Context, I'm a high school student, and was looking for either a free or affordable course(maybe on platforms like Udemy or any other), to learn C++, as I'm planning to give the INOI Olympiad ([https://www.iarcs.org.in/inoi/](https://www.iarcs.org.in/inoi/)) ZIO(Zonal), so I can qualify for IOI(International Olympiad in Informatics).

I have experience with using Javascript and Python, and I know web development.

So I needed some suggestions on any courses that I can take, which could help me prepare for the Olympiad, and afterwards, I'll be practising the past papers of it.

Any help is appreciated

I particularly need resources from the community since most of the courses I see are focused on preping us for jobs, rather than olympiads",learnprogramming,2025-10-05T22:57:22,Reddit

JavaScript,"I don't know where I'm going with this, but I believe that I will make it out.","I am 21M

My dream is to become rich and escape the rat race so that I can buy whatever I want without even thinking about my bank balance. Every time I saw a new car, bike, phone the first thing that came into my mind is how do I get it and what should I do so that I could afford those things, and I thought like this even before seeing Tate. Tate came into my Instagram algorithms in 2022.

So I saw a Mustang and McLaren and I thought and worked on how to get those cars, how do I make that much money? I searched on the internet for highest paying jobs, and the one job that I saw was pilot. I thought that if I became a pilot I'll get huge salary like 7 lakh rs a month and I can save it till I'm 50 or 60 years old and get those cars. I searched about how to become a pilot for 1 year and (I was in plus one) I got the details.

Then I understood that becoming a pilot is not easy cause my family couldn't afford the fees even for a CPL and after CPL, the ATPL and type rating? Forget about it. And I got to know that the chances of getting a job as a pilot is hard too. So I dropped the dream of becoming an airline pilot. I got to know about the Indian Airforce and to become a pilot in the IAF I don't have to pay the fees. I liked it and I worked for it, after 14 years I can become an airline pilot too with that experience.

I passed plus two and took BSc Computer Science in 2022. In November 2022 Andrew Tate came into my Instagram algorithm and I liked the reels and left it, and on the coming days more and more reels of him came into my algorithm. I understood that if I want to own a supercar, I won't get it working as an employee. I understood that business is the only way (I didn't drop the IAF dream, I'm still preparing for AFCAT exam).

It's 2023 now so I searched the internet, YouTube on how to make money and many business models came and most of them were shit. I saw someone's video saying I can make hundreds of thousands of dollars selling ebooks on Amazon Kindle. So I went to ChatGPT and gave it a story line and we both worked together and made a story and I put all the chapters together and designed the ebook on Canva and I launched it on Kindle. Nobody bought it, no one even saw it.

I became desperate. I knew that that wouldn't work, I tried to find another way and then dropshipping came into my feed. I learned about dropshipping, I watched Jordan Brown's free dropshipping course and I understood that business model. I came up with a plan on what to sell and where to sell, it was November or December or January or Feb I don't know exactly.

I got to know that Trump was running for presidency in November 2024 so if I sell custom printed t-shirts with Trump's images and some of his dialogues like ""I am your retribution"", ""I am your warrior"" etc. and marketed them on Instagram with some reels showing Trump's videos and create an emotion among people they would buy it (I was doing print on demand).

I talked about it with my friend in college and he said he would edit the videos and I told him that we need to start it before April. He said yes and come April he didn't even edit a single video and I asked him why and he said I'll do it after the exams. I thought fuck it I'll do it myself and created videos and I posted on Insta.

I created a Shopify store too, I bought the domain uscartel.com and put the name US Cartel to my store. I thought that if this works I'll get rich by November cause Trump was in power mode :) I didn't know anything about marketing, no SEO, my reels didn't get any reach and no one bought anything from my store.

My store had no sale for 3 months and I understood that if I keep my store running I'll drain my mother's money cause she told me she will give me money to do business. So I shut down my store. I dropped it in August 2024. That plan also didn't work :)

I didn’t leave the dream of getting rich ever. I dropped dropshipping business. Then I came up with a plan to do Ecommerce. Still I need an online store, and I don't wanna drain any money on a Shopify store with no sales. I wanted to build my own ecom store so that I can control it fully, and guess what—I was learning React, JavaScript etc. along the way while I was doing all these business.

I know coding so I searched for ecom store building tutorial on YouTube and many videos came but they were all with Stripe PG. In India Stripe won't work. I got mad and desperate. Without a store I'm fucked. Then I saw one video built a store and watching it and let's say the video was 4hr 30min, I built until 4hr 20min and the last 10 min he started to integrate Stripe. FUCK. I wasted weeks damn.

Then finally I built one ecom store where I can connect whatever PG available in India. I connected Razorpay, I implemented all the essential features, I implemented infinite scroll etc. Finally after a long time I developed a fully functional, production-ready Ecommerce store myself, gave it my old brand name and launched it on my domain.

Now the store is set, I don't have to pay ₹2350/month now for Shopify store, I only have to pay ₹700/month for the backend and I only have to start paying that when I decide to enable the ""Buy Now / Checkout"" button. Until then I can run my website for free.

Now what I need are the products to sell. I chose to sell some useful products like gadgets and other stuff. Currently my plan is to sell useful products like some gadgets, appliances, home furnishing products etc. I learned some things from the failure of my old store, so I did SEO and I am trying to develop my SEO every day.

I told the suppliers that I am running an ecommerce store and I will order from you when I get the orders on my store and they said okay. So I built the store, I completed it in March 2025 and I still improve it too. In June or July I posted on Reddit and I got 2 sales, I got my first sale.

I went to the supplier and told them that I need this product and they said NO and I should buy from them at a minimum value of ₹5000. Most of the suppliers said the exact same thing. So I told one of them that they said they also support dropshipping model and it is clear in their message, and they told me that they don't support dropshipping model now.

I told them that this is my first sale and I will order more from them in the coming days and they said NO. I had no choice. I backed off, I refunded the customers their money and shut down the buy now option.

This time I learned a lesson that if you're gonna do an Ecommerce business, you need to have the products with you, otherwise don't even start it. Not in bulk, at least you should have 5 or 6 something quantity for each product that you plan to sell.

Now I am trying to find a way how to make some money to get those products and reopen my store. I am now a BSc CS graduate. I go every Sunday to teach +1 and +2 students tuition, I'll get 2000rs every month and I save that money to buy products.

I won't leave Ecom, came all this way not to quit. And I won't leave AFCAT, even if I don't get it I'll still study and go for the exam until my chances are over. I am turning 22 this month.

My plan A is to get rich doing business (that's the only way) I still got a lot to learn. Everyday I'll have problems, I am trying to find a way how to get rich with ecom. 

All I need is an Idea.

This is what I'm doing. 

I did all this cause I listened to Tate videos. 

This post is not to make anyone a fan of Tate, I was just saying my story and Tate played (still playing) a big tole in it. There might be some people who likes Tate and some who doesn't and that's your choice. 

This is not about Tate, This is my journey. ",smallbusinessindia,2025-10-05T22:51:09,Reddit
JavaScript,Why am I not getting interview calls after 700+ job applications in 3 months? 😞,"Hi everyone,

I’m a recent **Computer Science graduate(NIT)** and I’ve been actively applying for jobs for the past **3 months**. I’ve sent out more than **800+ applications** (for roles like **Software Engineer, SDE, Backend Developer**, etc.), but I haven’t received a **single interview call** — not even a response from recruiters.

Here’s what I’ve done so far:

* Tailored my resume for each job
* Added all my **projects** and **6-month internship experience**
* Highlighted relevant skills (**C++, JavaScript, React, Node.js**, etc.)

Despite all this, nothing seems to work and I’m starting to feel stuck and demotivated. 😔

I’d really appreciate any advice, feedback, or strategies that helped you land interviews as a fresher:

* What changes should I make to my **resume**?
* Are there better ways to **apply or network**?
* Should I focus more on **open-source contributions**, new **projects**, or something else?

Any honest feedback or tips would mean a lot. 🙏",careerguidance,2025-10-05T22:42:33,Reddit
