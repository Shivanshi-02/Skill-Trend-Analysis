First time making a manim project and oh wow I bit off more than I could chew. Video took me 5 months to make, but I chugged along at it for a few hours a day, and eventually it's done.

Coding code blocks are a bit of a struggle... can't resize the code mobject the way I want. so if I wanted a wider code block I'd add a bunch of spaces and a period at the last line.

There's also a really weird error where if the code block is too large, manim breaks and refuses to render the scene? I had to work with GitHub screenshots instead for that part.

Overall it was a grueling process, between coding -&gt; waiting for python to render it -&gt; look at it and see if it was fine -&gt; make fixes and repeat until decent.

Technology,Python,Buying advice: ThinkPad X1 Carbon G11 vs T14s Gen 4,"Hi everyone,

I need a new laptop and could really use some advice. After some disappointing experiences with my previous HP notebook (loud fan noise even when idle and a display with mayjor quality issues), I’m planning to switch to Lenovo.

 

Here’s what I’m looking for:

* A solid battery life for working on the go (ideally 4–6 hours).
* A quiet laptop for regular office tasks like Word, Outlook, Excel, and light Python coding.

 

On the thinkpad website there are some discounted models and the following two models seem promising:

1. **ThinkPad X1 Carbon G11**
   * Intel i5-1345U
   * 32 GB RAM
   * 512 GB SSD
   * 500 cd/m² IPS touch display
   * No OS
   * Price: \~€1100
2. **ThinkPad T14s Gen 4**
   * AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 7840U
   * 32 GB RAM
   * 512 GB SSD
   * 500 cd/m² IPS touch display
   * No OS
   * Price: \~€1250 *(The T14s can be customized, e.g., choosing a non-touch display with less brightness for €200 less)*

 

I know these are not the newest models, but they seem like solid options for my budget. That said, I have a few questions:

1. Are there any downsides to buying an older model like these?
2. Which of these models would you recommend in terms of overall quality and quiet performance during normal office work?
3. For the T14s, do you think it’s worth the €200 extra for the multitouch screen and slightly brighter display? Will this affect battery life significantly?

 

Also, if you have any other suggestions or alternatives, feel free to share! One thing I personally value is having non-soldered RAM, but I haven’t found any suitable configurations without them being either too expensive or having other drawbacks.

Thanks in advance for your help!",thinkpad,2025-09-10T01:05:52,https://reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/1ncsprc/buying_advice_thinkpad_x1_carbon_g11_vs_t14s_gen_4/,Reddit,NEUTRAL,0.5125

Technology,Python,Using Folium in Python to render the soil sample data collected for a potential lode claim,"Finally recovering from terrible virus, and prototyping some geochem mapping utilities using python and folium. 

You can take the data you receive in CSV format from the analytical lab of your choice, run it through Folium, and generate point or heat maps for looking for lode deposits under cover.

Now I can take soil samples for icp-ms from hiking in the warm months and map out interesting lode deposits under cover using point maps or heat maps through the winter.

I was going to use QGIS or SAGA GIS for this initially, but Leaflet / Folium / Python were super flexible for this purpose.

Is anyone collecting soil samples for other testing, or using ICP-MS testing and generating maps like this? 

I've seen similar maps to this in Shawn Ryan's claim filings up around Dawson City, and one of his TED talks inspired me to actually try this myself this year.

Technology,Python,Not able to to send POST data to HTTP Accept,"If I use Automate's own HTTP Request block to send POST data to HTTP Accept, it works.

If I make a javascript POST request to the HTTP Accept in my browser without actually passing any data, it works. Even if I pass an empty string as the data, it also works.

But If I make that same javascript request passing in any data at all, even a string with just a single space, it fails (flow stays on the HTTP Accept block), with the HTTP error showing 408.

I tried to look at the request headers in each case to possibly debug the issue. Since I cannot see the headers of the rejected request using HTTP Accept block since flow stays paused on the block in that case, I made the two same requests (i.e. one with Automate's HTTP Request, one through javascript in my browser) to a local python HTTP server on my computer instead of making them to the HTTP Accept block. Here are the headers from each:

From HTTP Request block:

    POST / HTTP/1.1

    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9

  
I thought hmm, maybe small chance the lower-case ""content-type"" header is the issue, maybe HTTP Accept is case-sensitive when reading these headers? But nope, I forced the HTTP Request block to send lower-case content-type by overriding the header, it still worked. So it's something else.

Technology,PyTorch,Neuromorphic computing and the future of edge AI,"By now, most IT professionals are well aware of the current CPU/GPU hardware architecture used for AI and the associated problems with power, cooling and connectivity. While these architectures have enabled breakthrough AI capabilities, they also face serious physical and operational constraints:Power consumption. A single data-center-grade GPU can draw 300–700 watts, and large training runs often require thousands of them operating in parallel.Cooling requirements. A high power draw results in significant thermal output, necessitating extensive liquid or air cooling systems, which add cost and complexity.Bandwidth bottlenecks. Moving massive datasets between memory, storage and compute units strains interconnects, introducing delays and consuming more energy.Latency. Even with high-speed networking, inference requests routed to cloud-based GPU clusters face network latency — problematic for time-critical applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles or cybersecurity defense.These constraints are pushing researchers and industry toward alternative computing architectures that can deliver high performance with drastically lower energy and infrastructure demands.Recently, many of my peers have been speculating about the effect quantum computing (QC) will have on AI, as if that will be the next big catalyst for AI to dominate everything. But due tovquantum’s major hurdles — qubit instability, error correction overhead and the need for cryogenic cooling — they are costly and impractical for the continuous, large-scale workloads that drive modern AI.While QC captures the mainstream headlines, neuromorphic computing has positioned itself as a force in the next era of AI. While conventional AI relies heavily on GPU/TPU-based architectures, neuromorphic systems mimic the parallel and event-driven nature of the human brain. The recently announced Darwin Monkey 3 by the Chinese Academy of Sciences signals a new stage in this race. With claims of outperforming traditional supercomputers in edge and energy‐constrained environments, the DM3 invites analysis of its potential impact.Life imitates artIn “Terminator 2: Judgment Day,” the T-800 explains that his brain runs on a “neural-net processor, a learning computer,” a piece of Hollywood sci-fi tech that seemed designed to make cyborgs sound more menacing. And against all reason, scientists have gone ahead and built it. Neuromorphic chips now mimic the very thing the scriptwriters imagined: brain-like processors that learn and adapt in real time. No, they’re not striding around in leather jackets with shotguns, but they are bringing artificial intelligence to the edge, disconnected and learning. What was once a cinematic plot device has quietly become a laboratory reality, proving that sometimes life really does imitate the movies.Comparative analysis: CPU/GPU vs. neuromorphic systemsTo appreciate the significance of neuromorphic breakthroughs, it is important to compare them directly with the dominant compute platforms of today, CPUs and GPUs.CPUs excel at general-purpose computing with strong single-threaded performance and broad software ecosystems. However, they struggle with massively parallel AI workloads and are power‐hungry at scale.GPUs/TPUs have become the backbone of modern AI training and inference, offering massive parallelism and mature frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Yet they are highly energy‐intensive, require cooling and infrastructure, and are less suitable for size, weight and power (SWaP)-constrained environments such as IoT or edge devices.Neuromorphic systems, in contrast, are designed around event-driven, spike-based architectures. They compute only when stimuli occur, yielding extraordinary energy efficiency and low-latency processing. This makes them highly suitable for real-time edge applications, adaptive control and on-device intelligence. However, neuromorphic platforms face limitations in tooling, developer familiarity and ecosystem maturity.AI on the edgeNeuromorphic hardware has shown promise in edge environments where power efficiency, latency and adaptability matter most. From wearable medical devices to battlefield robotics, systems that can “think locally” without requiring constant cloud connectivity offer clear advantages. Recent surveys in neuromorphic computing demonstrate applications spanning real‐time sensory processing, robotics and adaptive control.Healthcare and R&D bridgeHealthcare is a leading beneficiary of neuromorphic breakthroughs. Neuromorphic systems are being studied for diagnostics, prosthetics and personalized medicine. A recent review highlights how neuromorphic computing is contributing to diagnostic imaging, brain-computer interfaces and adaptive neuroprosthetics, bridging edge diagnosis with frontier R&D. For example, neuromorphic neuroprosthetics have shown promise in restoring sensory feedback to amputees, while low‐power neuromorphic imaging chips are enabling continuous patient monitoring.At the same time, Steve Furber and others stress that real‐time event‐driven sensors — such as event‐based vision systems — are where neuromorphic excels today. These systems only compute when stimuli occur, making them particularly valuable in healthcare wearables and medical imaging, where sparse, efficient data capture is critical.Industrial control systems (ICS)Industrial systems demand ultra‐low‐latency and robust decision‐making under uncertainty. Neuromorphic computing offers clear advantages in closed‐loop control, process optimization and anomaly detection. A paper published recently in Nature Communications demonstrates how spiking neural networks can handle nonlinear process control and adapt to disturbances in real time. This aligns with prior work on neuromorphic resilience in ICS, particularly in power grids, oil & gas and manufacturing, where continuous adaptation is critical.Why this matters in simple terms: Closed‐loop control is like a thermostat constantly adjusting heating to keep a room comfortable — neuromorphic chips allow ICS to make those adjustments instantly and efficiently. Process optimization is similar to cruise control in a car, keeping things running smoothly while using less fuel or energy. Anomaly detection works like a smoke detector, spotting early signs of trouble before they escalate. In industries where downtime costs millions, or where failures can be dangerous, these capabilities translate directly into safer, cheaper and more reliable operations.Aircraft and shippingApplications in aerospace and maritime domains leverage neuromorphic systems’ ability to process complex sensory streams while remaining power efficient. In aviation, neuromorphic processors can aid in autonomous navigation, fault detection and cockpit assistance. In shipping, neuromorphic computing supports sensor fusion and real‐time anomaly detection in harsh, bandwidth‐limited environments.LogisticsBeyond ICS and transportation, logistics presents a compelling use case for neuromorphic computing. A 2025 review of supply chain resilience emphasizes dynamic modeling through hybrid complex‐network and agent‐based approaches. Neuromorphic architectures mirror this hybrid paradigm, enabling parallel simulations, disruption response and adaptive re‐routing in real time. Practical applications include warehouse robotics, just‐in‐time inventory management and intermodal transport optimization. By integrating neuromorphic systems, logistics chains could achieve a higher degree of resilience, limiting ripple effects during global disruptions.Security and SOC applicationsAnother promising area is cybersecurity and Security Operations Centers (SOCs). Spiking neural networks (SNNs) process data in an event‐driven fashion, making them ideal for real‐time anomaly detection with minimal energy overhead. Their selective processing also enhances privacy by limiting unnecessary data exposure, a key advantage in handling sensitive information. Emerging work on spiking neural P systems shows effectiveness in malware detection, phishing identification and spam filtering with fewer training cycles than conventional deep learning systems. Early findings also suggest that SNNs may be more resilient to adversarial attacks due to their spike‐based encoding and nonlinear temporal dynamics.More recently, a US government‐backed study demonstrated that neuromorphic platforms such as BrainChip’s Akida 1000 and Intel’s Loihi 2 can achieve up to 98.4% accuracy in multiclass attack detection, matching full‐precision GPUs while consuming far less power. These chips were tested across nine network traffic types, including multiple attack categories and benign traffic, showing their suitability for deployment in aircraft, UAVs and edge gateways where size, weight, power and cost (SWaP‐C) constraints are critical. This represents a leap over earlier prototypes (~93.7% accuracy), aided by improved tooling like Intel’s Lava framework. Combined with advances in semi‐supervised and continual learning, neuromorphic SOC solutions are now capable of adapting to evolving threats while minimizing catastrophic forgetting.Equally important, neuromorphic AI is directly tackling the SWaP problem that prevents conventional AI from running effectively at the edge. In 2022, more than 112 million IoT devices were compromised, and IoT malware surged by 400% the following year. Neuromorphic processors, such as Akida 1000, address these challenges by delivering on‐device, event‐driven anomaly detection without heavy infrastructure requirements. This positions neuromorphic SOC technologies as a practical path to securing IoT, UAVs and critical infrastructure endpoints that cannot support traditional AI models.Market and strategic implicationsDarwin Monkey 3 symbolizes more than a technological achievement; it reflects geopolitical competition in next‐generation AI hardware. The ability to deploy neuromorphic systems across healthcare, ICS, defense, logistics and security may shape both national resilience and private‐sector competitiveness. Importantly, as Furber notes, the hardware is ready — but the ecosystem isn’t. Development tools akin to TensorFlow or PyTorch are still emerging (e.g., PyNN, Lava), and convergence toward standards will be crucial for widespread adoption (IEEE Spectrum, 2024).Adding to this, a 2025–2035 global market forecast projects significant growth in neuromorphic computing and sensing, spanning sectors such as healthcare, automotive, logistics, aerospace and cybersecurity. The study profiles more than 140 companies, from established giants like Intel and IBM to startups such as BrainChip and Prophesee, which are releasing joint products now, underscoring the breadth of investment and innovation. It also emphasizes challenges in standardization, tooling and supply chain readiness, suggesting that the race will not just be technological but also commercial and regulatory.Ethics and sustainabilityAs neuromorphic computing matures, ethical and sustainability considerations will shape adoption as much as raw performance. Spiking neural networks’ efficiency reduces carbon footprints by cutting energy demands compared to GPUs, aligning with global decarbonization targets. At the same time, ensuring that neuromorphic models are transparent, bias‐aware and auditable is critical for applications in healthcare, defense and finance. Calls for AI governance frameworks now explicitly include neuromorphic AI, reflecting its potential role in high‐stakes decision‐making. Embedding sustainability and ethics into the neuromorphic roadmap will ensure that efficiency gains do not come at the cost of fairness or accountability.A paradigm shift in AI?Will Darwin Monkey 3 spark a paradigm shift in AI? The answer lies in adoption and integration. Neuromorphic computing is no longer theoretical — it is moving into applied domains from healthcare to logistics to cybersecurity. Yet the field still searches for its “killer app” — a domain where neuromorphic’s efficiency and adaptability decisively outperform conventional AI. As industries face rising energy costs and escalating cyber‐physical risks, neuromorphic solutions offer a forward‐looking path that blends efficiency, adaptability, resilience and responsibility.This article is published as part of the Foundry Expert Contributor Network.Want to join?",cio,2025-09-08T11:11:00,https://www.cio.com/article/4052223/neuromorphic-computing-and-the-future-of-edge-ai.html,NewsData,NEUTRAL,0.5526

Technology,PyTorch,"Feedback / tips for training DINO - this is histopathology application, but I am just trying to learn general technique for hyperparameter tuning this type of model","I am working on training DINO on histopathology data. This is to serve as a foundation model for supervised segmentation and classification models, as well as a tool for understanding the structure of my data.

**TLDR / main question:** How do people typically tune this / evaluate DINO training? I know downstream, I can look at cluster metrics (silhouette score, etc.) and linear probing for subset of labeled data. But for quicker train time eval, what do you do? This is for tuning EMA, temp, aug strength, etc. I shouldn't focus on loss because this relative to K. **Do I focus on teacher entropy when hyper parameter tuning?** That is what I've been doing (ChatGPT might have had some influence here). I am hoping from some practical, real-world tips for how people focus their energy when tuning / optimizing SSL models, particularly DINO. Do I need to jump to cluster / linear probe metrics? Or are there training metrics I can focus on?

  
Some more details / context:

I'm using a combination of PyTorch lightning, timm, and Lightly to build my model and training pipeline.

I tried to follow the precedent of the recent major papers in this area (UNI, Virchow2, PLUTO) and vanilla DINO training protocols. I first break my whole slide images (WSIs) into tiles that  and then generate random global and local crops from these. I only have around 50k tiles from my 2-3k source images, so I was starting with ConvNeXt instead of ViTs. Or maybe I'm being too cautious?

I started with vanilla DINO training params and have only been tweaking them as necessary to avoid flatness collapse (teacher entropy = ln(K)) and sharpness collapse (teacher entropy dipping too low, i.e. approaching zero). The major deviations I've made from vanilla

1. I had to change EMA schedule to be 0.998-&gt;0.9999. Starting with lower EMA led sharpness collapse (teacher entropy diving towards 0)
2. I also had to change teacher temp to 0.075 (up from 0.07). Boosting temp much past this led the model to get stuck with teacher entropy = ln(K)
3. I also dropped K to 8192 because ChatGPT told me that helps with stability.

It seems to be working, but my cluster metrics are not quite as great as I am hoping (silhouette \~0.25) and cluster purity isn't quite there either. But I probably need to spend some time on my image retrieval protocol. Right now I'm just doing L2-&gt;PCA-&gt;L2 on my embeddings -&gt; Leiden clustering -&gt; Umap plotting and then randomly querying images from my various clusters and eye balling how ""pure"" it looks.",learnmachinelearning,2025-09-10T00:29:55,https://reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1ncrpub/feedback_tips_for_training_dino_this_is/,Reddit,NEUTRAL,0.6507
Technology,PyTorch,"For my engineering thesis, I have to build a hybrid chess engine","Hey everyone!

For my engineering thesis, I have to build a hybrid chess engine. I’m a bit unsure about the best approach to take because “hybrid” can be broken down into many more specific subcategories.

Here’s my current idea:

* Implement minimax with alpha-beta pruning using an existing C++ chess library.
* Train a PyTorch model on grandmaster games. Unfortunately, I’d probably focus on teaching the model to memorize positions rather than truly “understand” chess, since teaching it to play general chess might require hundreds of thousands or even millions of games. If anyone knows a way around this, I’d love to be corrected.
* Create a function to choose the best move by combining both: minimax + model, where minimax kicks in when the model is uncertain about its choice.

The part I’m stuck on: evaluation function. Should I rely on heuristics, or should the model itself learn to evaluate positions?

Also, I’m concerned about hardware limitations. My setup is:

* AMD RX 6800
* Intel i5-12400F
* 16 GB RAM

Do you think it’s realistic to aim for \~2000 ELO on this hardware? And does using ROCm impose any constraints I should be aware of?

If anyone has pro tips on building a hybrid chess engine, training models on chess, or combining classical AI with ML, I’d really appreciate your help!",ComputerChess,2025-09-10T00:09:13,https://reddit.com/r/ComputerChess/comments/1ncr5i1/for_my_engineering_thesis_i_have_to_build_a/,Reddit,NEUTRAL,0.4981

I can't find any documentation or source code for this version of the function.  I'm not sure where to look next.

For completeness, let me explain why I'm trying to do this.  I want to implement a custom normalization layer.  I'm finding it uses a lot more memory than batch norm does.  I want to compare to the source code for batch norm to understand the differences.

In Feb ’25, researchers found malicious models on Hugging Face that abused “broken Pickle” to evade Picklescan, Hugging Faces Pickle file scanner, and open reverse shells, a clever attack which opens outbound connections to an foreign server.  

Mere weeks later, researchers recently spotted three newly published PyPI packages masquerading as a “Python SDK” for Aliyun AI Labs. After install, the setup routine loads a PyTorch model whose serialized contents act as an info-stealer, collecting basic info about the infected machine, file reading .gitconfig.

Why hide code in ML models?

Because most security stacks are only now adding real detections for ML file types. Formats like Pickle have been treated as “data for sharing,” not executable containers, so they slip past scanners.

This is an undeniable and recent example that demonstrates why a zero-trust boundary for all file types is essential to protect your development environment.

Technology,PyTorch,Pytorch lightning vs pytorch,"Today at work, i was criticized by a colleague for implementing my training script in pytorch instead of pytorch lightning. His rationale was that the same thing could've been done in less code using lightning, and more code means more documentation and explaining to do. I havent familiarized myself with pytorch lightning yet so im not sure if this is fair criticism, or something i should take with a grain of salt. I do intend to read the lightning docs soon but im just thinking about this for my own learning.

Technology,PyTorch,Best resources for someone who learns by following a proper structure?,"I learn best by following a proper structure (think about following a class about ML/DL, so introducing the library, then the basic functions, then some exercises, and repeat).

I have a background in mathematics and some data science, I just want to dive deeper in the world of ML/DL, in particular learning the various tools and libraries, mainly PyTorch.  
However I don't like particularly going on the documentation to learn; I still do that when I have doubts or need to implement something, but to learn something I prefer something like either a book, a course online, some roadmap that gamify the experience, I hope I am giving the correct idea on how I learn best.

What are some resources for me?",learnmachinelearning,2025-09-09T20:18:43,https://reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1nckyw5/best_resources_for_someone_who_learns_by/,Reddit,NEUTRAL,0.5318
Technology,PyTorch,✨ Machines That Dream &amp; Laugh With Us: The New Magic of Everyday Machine Learning! 🚀,"Hey fellow tinkerers, data dreamers, and curious minds! 🚀

Let’s talk about MACHINE LEARNING—the buzzword that won’t quit and, honestly, I’m glad it hasn’t. There’s something ridiculously exciting about how the world is shifting thanks to machines that learn, adapt, and surprise us almost every day. And sometimes those surprises are...well, *awesome*!

First off, the sheer **speed of progress** in ML sometimes makes my head spin.

- Remember when doing image recognition meant laboriously drawing boxes over cat photos? (Okay, some of you definitely still do this, sorry!)
- And now you can just whip up a pre-trained model that can spot not just a cat, but Tommy, the neighbor’s tabby, in about two lines of code.

How cool is it that kids learning to code today start with tools like TensorFlow, huggingface, or PyTorch? Easily accessible. Completely open. You don’t need a PhD or a university supercomputer. The gatekeepers are *gone*.

But what really gets me jazzed are the emerging **creative applications**:

- Music that evolves as you listen.
- Machines learning your favorite ice cream flavor combos.
- Automated scripts that chase down better job postings while you sleep.
- AI-generated art that makes you step back and wonder, “wait, how did it know I wanted a nebula with tiny hamsters floating through it?”

It’s not just about the tech. It’s about seeing:

- Devs and researchers from all around the world collaborating for fun and progress.  
- Hobbyists making AI chatbots for their D&amp;D sessions.
- Students building climate models in their dorm rooms.

We’re genuinely co-creating with the machines now. **It’s as if there's a new teammate at our desk, ready to prototype ideas at 3am and never asking for coffee.**

Here’s what excites me—maybe it’ll spark something in you, too:

- What wild use-case have you dreamed up, just for the fun of it?
- If ML were as easy as napkin sketches, what would you build?
- Can we push machine learning into areas nobody’s explored because it seemed “too silly”?

I love that, in *this moment*, we can be playful. We can be serious. We can put a llama on the moon *and* get distracted by the world’s most over-engineered recipe generator.

The truth is:

**We’re only just getting started.**

So, r/GPTAppsEngine, hit me with your weirdest, brightest, and happiest ML stories—whether it’s a goofy friendship algorithm, or a project that made your jaw drop in delight.

Let’s let the machines *learn* and us *laugh!*",GPTAppsEngine,2025-09-09T19:59:09,https://reddit.com/r/GPTAppsEngine/comments/1nckgh8/machines_that_dream_laugh_with_us_the_new_magic/,Reddit,POSITIVE,0.8561
Technology,PyTorch,Beginner Python is just the start...,"When I first finished beginner Python, I thought: Okay… what now?  
I could write loops, functions, and classes but I had no clue where Python could actually take me. I worried I’d wasted months learning something that wouldn’t lead to a real career. That’s where most beginners stop. They learn the basics but never see the bigger picture and Python quietly slips away from their resume. The truth? Python isn’t just a language. It’s a gateway into dozens of careers. And the path you choose depends on what excites you most.

If you like building apps, Python can turn you into a web developer with Flask or Django, a full-stack engineer with PostgreSQL, a desktop app dev with Tkinter or PyQt, or even a cloud engineer mixing Python with AWS and Docker.

If you’re drawn to data and AI, Python is the 1 skill: analyzing data with Pandas and NumPy, training models with Scikit-learn or PyTorch, working on NLP with HuggingFace, or building computer vision systems with OpenCV. These skills open doors to data analyst, ML engineer, and even research roles.

If you lean toward automation and DevOps, Python lets you script away boring tasks, build bots, run cloud automation with AWS Lambda, or even step into DevOps/SRE roles by combining it with Terraform, Ansible, and shell scripting.

And if you’re fascinated by security, IoT, or creative tech, Python takes you there too from ethical hacking with Scapy and Nmap, to robotics with Raspberry Pi and ROS, to generative AI, 3D animation, and even bioinformatics research.

The possibilities are insane. Python is one of the rare skills that doesn’t lock you into one career it opens a thousand doors.
