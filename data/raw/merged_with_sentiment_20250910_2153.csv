Technology,Python,[FOR HIRE] Data Scientist - I Will Automate Your Workflow or Build a Predictive Model NOW | $1k+,"I am a Data Scientist and Python expert, and I have immediate availability for one new project this week.

I help businesses stop wasting time and money on manual processes by building automated solutions. If you have a repetitive task, a messy dataset, or need to predict future outcomes, I can build you a custom tool.

**I can deliver solutions like:**

* **Process Automation:** Automate your Excel/Google Sheets reports, data entry, or web scraping.
* **Predictive Models:** Forecast sales, customer churn, inventory demand, etc.
* **Data Cleaning Pipelines:** Transform your messy data into a clean, usable format.
* **Custom Dashboards:** Build a live dashboard to track your key metrics.

**Why hire me?**

* **Focus on Results:** I don't just deliver code; I deliver a solution that saves you time and makes you money.
* **Fast Turnaround:** I can start immediately and deliver most projects within 1-2 weeks.
* **Clear Pricing:** Fixed project pricing starting at **$1,000**. No surprises.

**I am looking for one serious client with a budget ready to go.**

If you need a problem solved this week, send me a DM with:

1. A brief description of what you need.
2. Your goal (e.g., ""automate daily sales reports"").
3. Your budget.

Let's get to work.

Technology,Python,Need guidance,"Hi Folks,

I’m currently working as a QA Engineer with 5 years of experience, and I’m looking to transition into a DevOps Engineer role. Over the years, I’ve gained strong exposure to testing processes, automation, and collaboration with development teams, and I’d like to build on that by moving into DevOps.

I would really appreciate guidance from those who have made a similar shift or are already working in DevOps:
	•	What skills/certifications should I prioritize?
	•	Are there specific tools or projects I should focus on to make my profile stronger?
	•	How can I utilise my QA background/ experience while applying for DevOps roles?

I have a basic understanding of Linux and coding experience in python.

Your inputs will be very valuable to me.",devops,2025-09-10T21:25:08,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1ndi25z/need_guidance/,Reddit,POSITIVE,0.8135
Technology,Python,AI-Rulez v2.0: Universal AI Assistant Configuration Management,"I'm happy to showcase AI-Rulez v2, which is a major next step in the development of this tool. 

**The Problem:** If you're using multiple AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot), you've probably noticed the configuration fragmentation. Each tool demands its own format - `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Keeping coding standards consistent across all these tools is frustrating and error-prone.

**The Solution:** AI-Rulez lets you write your project configuration once and automatically generates native files for every AI tool - current and future ones. It's like having a build system for AI context.

## Why This Matters for Development Teams

Teams using AI assistants face common challenges:
- **Multiple tools, multiple configs**: Your team uses Claude Code for reviews, Cursor for development, Copilot for completions
- **Framework-specific standards**: Type safety, testing patterns, dependency management (uv, poetry, npm, etc.)  
- **Monorepo complexity**: Multiple services and packages all need different AI contexts
- **Team consistency**: Junior devs get different AI guidance than seniors

AI-Rulez solves this with a single `ai-rulez.yaml` that understands your project's conventions.

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Project Analysis
The `init` command is where AI-Rulez shines. Instead of manually writing configurations, let AI analyze your codebase:

```bash
# AI analyzes your codebase and generates tailored config
uvx ai-rulez init ""My Project"" --preset popular --use-agent claude --yes
```

This automatically:
- Detects your tech stack (Python/Node/Go, testing frameworks, linters)
- Identifies project patterns and conventions
- Generates appropriate coding standards and practices
- Creates specialized agents for different tasks (code review, testing, docs)
- **Automatically adds all generated AI files to .gitignore** - no more committing `.cursorrules` or `CLAUDE.md` by accident

### Universal Output Generation
One YAML config generates files for every tool:

```yaml
# ai-rulez.yaml
metadata:
  name: ""Python API Service""

presets:
  - ""popular""  # Auto-configures Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot

rules:
  - name: ""Python Type Safety""
    priority: critical
    content: |
      - Python 3.11+ with complete type annotations
      - Use | for unions: str | None not Optional[str]
      - mypy strict mode required
      - Type all function signatures and returns

  - name: ""Testing Standards""
    priority: high
    content: |
      - pytest with async support and fixtures
      - 100% coverage for new code
      - Use factory_boy for test data
      - Integration tests with real PostgreSQL

agents:
  - name: ""python-reviewer""
    description: ""Python code review specialist""
    system_prompt: ""Focus on type safety, performance, and Pythonic patterns""
```

Run `uvx ai-rulez generate` and get:
- `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code
- `.cursorrules` for Cursor
- `.windsurfrules` for Windsurf  
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot
- Custom formats for any future AI tool

### Advanced Features

**MCP Server Integration**: Direct integration with Claude Code and other MCP-compatible tools:
```bash
# Start built-in MCP server with 19 configuration management tools
uvx ai-rulez mcp
```

**Comprehensive CLI**: Manage configs without editing YAML:
```bash
# Add Python-specific rules on the fly
uvx ai-rulez add rule ""FastAPI Standards"" --priority high --content ""Use Pydantic v2 models with Field validation""

# Create specialized agents
uvx ai-rulez add agent ""pytest-expert"" --description ""Testing specialist for Python projects""
```

**Team Collaboration**: 
- Remote config includes: `includes: [""https://github.com/myorg/python-standards.yaml""]`
- Local overrides: Personal customization via `.local.yaml` files
- Monorepo support: `--recursive` flag handles complex Python projects

### Enterprise Features

**Security &amp; Compliance**:
- SSRF protection for remote config includes
- Schema validation prevents configuration errors
- Audit trails for configuration changes

**Performance**:
- Written in Go - instant startup even for large Python monorepos
- Concurrent generation for multiple output files
- Smart caching for remote configurations

## Target Audience

- **Python developers** using multiple AI coding assistants
- **Python teams** needing consistent AI behavior across projects  
- **DevOps engineers** managing AI configurations in CI/CD pipelines
- **Open source maintainers** wanting AI-ready Python project documentation
- **Enterprise teams** requiring centralized AI assistant management

## Comparison to Alternatives

### vs Manual Configuration Management
**Manual approach**: Maintain separate `.cursorrules`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.windsurfrules` files
- Problem: Configuration drift, inconsistent standards, manual syncing
- **AI-Rulez solution**: Single source generates all formats automatically

### vs Basic Tools (airules, template-ai)
**Basic tools**: Simple file copying or template systems
- **AI-Rulez advantages**: 
  - AI-powered codebase analysis and config generation
  - MCP protocol integration for live configuration management
  - Full CRUD CLI for configuration management
  - Enterprise security features and team collaboration

### vs Tool-Specific Solutions
**Tool-specific**: Each AI assistant has its own configuration system
- **AI-Rulez advantages**:
  - Future-proof: works with new AI tools without reconfiguration
  - Repository-level management for complex Python projects
  - Consistent behavior across your entire AI toolchain

## Installation &amp; Usage

```bash
# Install via pip
pip install ai-rulez

# Or run without installing
uvx ai-rulez init ""My Python Project"" --preset popular --yes

# Generate configuration files
ai-rulez generate

# Add to your pre-commit hooks
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/Goldziher/ai-rulez
    rev: v2.1.3
    hooks:
      - id: ai-rulez-validate
      - id: ai-rulez-generate
```

## Real-World Example

Here's how a Django + React monorepo benefits from AI-Rulez:

```yaml
# ai-rulez.yaml
extends: ""https://github.com/myorg/python-base.yaml""

sections:
  - name: ""Architecture""
    content: |
      - Django REST API backend with PostgreSQL
      - React TypeScript frontend
      - Celery for async tasks
      - Docker containerization

agents:
  - name: ""django-expert""
    system_prompt: ""Django specialist focusing on DRF, ORM optimization, and security""
  
  - name: ""frontend-reviewer""  
    system_prompt: ""React/TypeScript expert for component architecture and testing""

mcp_servers:
  - name: ""database-tools""
    command: ""uvx""
    args: [""mcp-server-postgres""]
    env:
      DATABASE_URL: ""postgresql://localhost/myproject""
```

This generates tailored configurations for each AI tool, ensuring consistent guidance whether you're working on Django models or React components.

Technology,Python,Claude Code SDK for non-coding,"Is anyone using the Claude Code SDK to build agents? (Note: the typescript/python CC sdk library)

I used it recently to prototype a coding agent and it was as good as you imagine. I just gave it access to a couple more MCP tools and built an UI for it. It's still somewhat early though. Eg, the API is missing a little functionality and it's not documented how to deploy it.

I'm interested in using it for **non-coding tasks**, so I was wondering if anyone is using it in that way. All there is to do is give it access to MCP tools. We could give it access to n8n/zapier workflows!

I have applied to \~100 new grad/ internship roles and I am not getting responses besides online assessments which I am doing well on. So I believe my resume is the bottleneck for me right now.

I am targeting roles in Data Science/ Data Analytics/ Machine Learning. I am applying for both new grad and internship, and changing my graduation month accordingly (May/ December).

I am applying to roles in my current city as well as New York, DC, and California.

In terms of my resume, I think I am having issues delivering a business impact and not just listing tasks for my experiences. I know recruiters will have a less technical background, but I'm not sure how to balance keeping technical skills in my roles while also emphasizing impact and keeping my experiences understandable to a recruiter. Also, should my current roles be in present tense? Some bullet points I have completed and others are still in progress.

Technology,PyTorch,Sebastian Raschka just released a complete Qwen3 implementation from scratch - performance benchmarks included,"

Found this incredible repo that breaks down exactly how Qwen3 models work: 

https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/tree/main/ch05/11_qwen3

TL;DR: Complete PyTorch implementation of Qwen3 (0.6B to 32B params) with zero abstractions. Includes real performance benchmarks and optimization techniques that give 4x speedups.

Why this is different

Most LLM tutorials are either:
- High-level API wrappers that hide everything important
- Toy implementations that break in production  
- Academic papers with no runnable code

This is different. It's the actual architecture, tokenization, inference pipeline, and optimization stack - all explained step by step.

The performance data is fascinating

Tested Qwen3-0.6B across different hardware:

Mac Mini M4 CPU:
- Base: 1 token/sec (unusable)
- KV cache: 80 tokens/sec (80x improvement!)
- KV cache + compilation: 137 tokens/sec

Nvidia A100:
- Base: 26 tokens/sec  
- Compiled: 107 tokens/sec (4x speedup from compilation alone)
- Memory usage: ~1.5GB for 0.6B model

The difference between naive implementation and optimized is massive.

What's actually covered

- Complete transformer architecture breakdown
- Tokenization deep dive (why it matters for performance)
- KV caching implementation (the optimization that matters most)
- Model compilation techniques  
- Batching strategies
- Memory management for different model sizes
- Qwen3 vs Llama 3 architectural comparisons

 The ""from scratch"" approach

This isn't just another tutorial - it's from the author of ""Build a Large Language Model From Scratch"". Every component is implemented in pure PyTorch with explanations for why each piece exists.

You actually understand what's happening instead of copy-pasting API calls.

Practical applications

Understanding this stuff has immediate benefits:
- Debug inference issues when your production LLM is acting weird
- Optimize performance (4x speedups aren't theoretical)
- Make informed decisions about model selection and deployment
- Actually understand what you're building instead of treating it like magic

Repository structure

- Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step walkthroughs
- Standalone Python scripts for production use
- Multiple model variants (including reasoning models)
- Real benchmarks across different hardware configs
- Comparison frameworks for different architectures

Has anyone tested this yet?

The benchmarks look solid but curious about real-world experience. Anyone tried running the larger models (4B, 8B, 32B) on different hardware?

Also interested in how the reasoning model variants perform - the repo mentions support for Qwen3's ""thinking"" models.

Why this matters now

Local LLM inference is getting viable (0.6B models running 137 tokens/sec on M4!), but most people don't understand the optimization techniques that make it work.

This bridges the gap between ""LLMs are cool"" and ""I can actually deploy and optimize them.""

What is the “stable” set of versions (torch, torchvision, torchaudio, xformers, numpy) that you are successfully running ComfyUI with on RTX 4070 (12GB, CUDA 12.1)?

Any working requirements.txt or install order would be a huge help. Thanks!

Technology,PyTorch,Regain Hard Drive Space Tips (aka Where does all my drive space go ?),"# HD/SSD Space

**Overview** : this guide will show you where space has gone (the big ones) upon installing SD installs. 

**Risks** : Caveat Empor, it should be safe to flush out your Pip cache as an install will download anything needed again,  but the other steps need more of an understanding of what install is doing what - especially for Diffusers . If you want to start from scratch or had enough of it all, that removes risk.

**Cache Locations:** Yes, you can redirect/move these caches to exist elsewhere but if you know how to do that, I'd suggest this guide isn't for you.

\-----

You’ll notice your hard drive space dropping faster than sales of Tesla when you start installing diffusion installs. Not just your dedicated drive (if you use one) but your c: drive as well – this won’t be a full list of where the space goes and how to reclaim some of it – permanently or temporarily.

1.       Pip cache  (usually located at c:\\users\\username\\appdata\\local\\pip\\cache)

2.       Huggingface cache (usually at c:\\users\\username\\.cache\\huggingface

3.       Duplicates - Models with two names or locations (thank you Comfy)



# Pip Cache

Open a CMD window and type :

**Pip cache dir**   (this tells you where pip is caching the files it downloads)

&gt;c:\\users\\username\\appdata\\local\\pip\\cache

**Pip cache info**    (this gives you the info on the cache ie size and whls built)

&gt;Package index page cache location (pip v23.3+): c:\\users\\username\\appdata\\local\\pip\\cache\\http-v2

&gt;Package index page cache location (older pips): c:\\users\\username\\appdata\\local\\pip\\cache\\http

&gt;Package index page cache size: 31877.7 MB

&gt;Number of HTTP files: 3422

&gt;Locally built wheels location: c:\\users\\username\\appdata\\local\\pip\\cache\\wheels

&gt;Locally built wheels size: 145.9 MB

&gt;Number of locally built wheels: 36

**Pip cache list**     (this gives you a breakdown of the whls that have been built as part of installs of ui’s and node installs)

NB if your pc took multiple hours to build any of these , make a copy of them for easier installation next time eg flash attention

&gt;Cache contents:

&gt; \- GPUtil-1.4.0-py3-none-any.whl (7.4 kB)

&gt; \- aliyun\_python\_sdk\_core-2.16.0-py3-none-any.whl (535 kB)

&gt;\- filterpy-1.4.5-py3-none-any.whl (110 kB)

&gt; \- flash\_attn-2.5.8-cp312-cp312-win\_amd64.whl (116.9 MB)

&gt; \- flashinfer\_python-0.2.6.post1-cp39-abi3-win\_amd64.whl (5.1 MB)

**Pip cache purge** (yup, it does what it says on the tin &amp; deletes the cache) .

*Pros* In my example here, I’ll regain 31gb(ish) . Very useful for deleting nightly pytorch builds that can accumulate in my case.

*Cons* It will still redownload the common ones each time it needs them



# Huggingface Cache

Be very very careful with this cache as its hard to tell what is in there –

ABOVE: Diffuser models and others are downloaded into this folder and then link into your models folder (ie elsewhere) . Yup, 343gb gulp.

https://preview.redd.it/ye8k4btbcbof1.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06c6053ed9600f8f7711d0b25642b8df1157092b

As you can see from the dates - they suggest that I can safely delete the older files BUT I must stress, delete files in this folder at your own risk and after due diligence , although if you are starting from scratch again, it puts aside risk. 

I just moved the older ones to a temp folder and used the SD installs that I still use to check.



# Duplicates

Given the volume and speed of ‘models’ being introduced and workflows that download them or it being done manually and a model folder structure that cries itself to sleep everyday, it is inevitable that copies are made of big models with the same name or with tweaks .

Personally I use Dupeguru for this task, although it can be done manually ""quite"" easily if your models folder is under control and subfoldered properly....lol . 

Again - be careful deleting things (especially Diffusers), I prefer to rename files for a period with an added ""copy"" in the filename, so they can be found easily with a search or rerun of Dupeguru (others are available). Deepguru can also just move files as well (ie instead of firing the Delete shotgun straight away).

ABOVE: I have had Dupeguru compare my HuggingFace cache with my models folder.

I value my time dealing with SD and have about 40TB of drives, so I wrote this guide to procrastinate sorting it all out .",StableDiffusion,2025-09-10T16:45:13,https://reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1ndbceq/regain_hard_drive_space_tips_aka_where_does_all/,Reddit,NEUTRAL,0.5855
Technology,PyTorch,VibeVoice Generation In ComfyUI Ends Prematurely. Not Running Out of VRAM.,"Getting ConnectionResetErrors left and right.  The VibeVoiceTTS node still creates the MP3 output and it sounds ok sometimes but pretty bad other times, I'm guessing because it is finishing too early.  This is not a VRAM issue...I have a 3090 24GB VRAM and this happens whether I use the Large VibeVoice model or the 1.5B which only uses like 7GB VRAM.

I tried updating comfyui and dependencies but it ended up creating a numpy error for some reason that made the node not work at all.  So what you see here is from a fresh install of ComfyUI portable and then installing the VibeVoiceTTS node with ComfyUI manager.

I am also using a short script in this generation example, only about 6 short sentences total.",StableDiffusion,2025-09-10T15:04:39,https://reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1nd9lxq/vibevoice_generation_in_comfyui_ends_prematurely/,Reddit,NEGATIVE,0.5053
Technology,PyTorch,D2L or Fast.AI for Deep Learning,"I’m in college right now and thinking about a career as an MLE. I want to get a solid grasp on deep learning and am looking for a good free resource. I’m torn between D2L’s Dive into Deep Learning and the Fast.ai courses. D2L seems nice because it’s more recently updated and teaches “pure” PyTorch as sometimes I worry with Fast.ai I might become too dependent on their framework. On the other hand, Fast.ai has the advantage of getting hands-on with projects right from the start. I could also pair FastAi with Andrew Ng’s YouTube DL specialization. I’d love to hear any insight on them or any advice in general.

Technology,PyTorch,Feel Betrayed by Aurélien Géron &amp; his Hands On ML with TenorFlow,"After spending months learning machine learning and deep learning with TensorFlow using Aurélien Géron's *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow*, I discovered that the author is now working on a PyTorch version of his book. I came across several comments from people who preferred PyTorch, but when I searched online, TensorFlow was often praised for its ""production and deployment"" capabilities, while PyTorch was favored in research settings. Since I'm preparing to enter the job market, I figured TensorFlow would be the more practical choice.

However, it now feels like TensorFlow is becoming increasingly abandoned. Géron even mentions in his book that PyTorch is gaining momentum. Still, he points out that the competition between the two frameworks benefits both, and once you've learned TensorFlow, many of the skills are transferable.

That’s true—I’ve learned a lot about deep learning, mostly focused on sequence modeling and NLP rather than computer vision or reinforcement learning. But I’ve always had this nagging feeling that it wasn’t worth investing so much time learning TensorFlow’s quirks and complexities. I dove deep into building custom training loops and components like layers and loss functions. With that foundation, picking up PyTorch has been much easier.

Yet I can’t help but think: if I had spent all that time learning PyTorch instead, I’d have gained much more experience with it. And when I saw that even the author moved away from TensorFlow, I felt genuinely betrayed.",deeplearning,2025-09-10T12:05:39,https://reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1nd6wgs/feel_betrayed_by_aurélien_géron_his_hands_on_ml/,Reddit,NEUTRAL,0.5128

Technology,PyTorch,What is an AI Model Library?,"An AI Model Library is a centralized repository of pre-built, pre-trained artificial intelligence models that developers and data scientists can easily access and use. These models cover a wide range of tasks, such as image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and recommendation systems. Instead of building models from scratch, users can quickly integrate models into their applications, saving time and resources. The library typically provides models in various formats, along with documentation, usage examples, and performance benchmarks. It supports faster development of AI solutions, especially for businesses that want to implement AI without deep expertise in machine learning. Popular [AI model libraries](https://cyfuture.ai/ai-model-library) include TensorFlow Hub, Hugging Face Model Hub, and PyTorch Hub.
