Java,MD to HTML simple idea,"Like many of you, I live in Markdown for all my notes, documentation, and reports. It's fast and efficient for writing, but I always hated sharing the raw .md files with clients or non-technical stakeholders.  


It just looks unprofessional. The code blocks are flat walls of text, and the whole document feels like a messy first draft, not a polished final report.

So, I decided to build a simple tool to fix this for myself: a web-based converter that transforms plain Markdown into a clean, professional HTML page with proper syntax highlighting.



You can try it out here: [https://boldtake.io/md-to-html](https://boldtake.io/md-to-html)



What it does:  


Instantly converts your Markdown to clean HTML.

Adds VS Code-style syntax highlighting for 190+ languages.

Has a live preview that updates as you type.

Includes light/dark themes.

Lets you copy or download the final HTML with one click.

It's free, and no sign-up is needed.



I built this to solve my own problem, but I'm sure others have similar frustrations. I'd love to get some feedback from this community.

My main question for you all is: What else do you wish you could do with your Markdown files?

Are there other formats you constantly need to convert to (like clean PDFs, Word docs)? Do you need pre-made templates for certain types of reports? Any other annoying little problems you face when sharing your work?

I'm happy to build out more features based on what people actually need. Let me know what you think, or if there's anything else I can help with!

Thanks for checking it out.",SideProject,2025-10-07T12:09:25,Reddit
Java,sVanilla Survival [SMP] [Semi-Vanilla] {Crossplay Enabled} {No Crystal PvP},"sVanilla Survival: A Sword based PVP SMP for java &amp; bedrock geyser. 

 IP: corn.gg

 Region: USA East

sVanilla Survival was founded in 2019 with the goal of providing a no cheating, pvp raiding experience that is centered around melee based pvp. We're dedicated to providing the old-school SMP experience, with a large map that never resets, no land claims, and most importantly - crystal free PvP.

 So why choose sVanilla Survival?

 -&gt; Fair-Play Raiding: On sVanilla we favor the ability of players to have freedom in how they play the game. While we do enforce rules to keep the experience fairplay; you can greif, pvp, team with or betray other players. Only the strong survive on sVanilla.

 -&gt; Melee Based PVP: On sVanilla crystals and anchors are disabled to allow the older pvp style of sword to take its place. To add balance to the sword meta, We have patched breach swapping, have a combat tag system in place with pvp restrictions such as no elytra in combat &amp; an 8 second totem cooldown. 

 -&gt; Quality of Life: While we love vanilla, we also understand the need for a few tweaks. We've implemented a few quality-of-life modifications to enhance gameplay without deviating from the authentic feel. Teleport, Ignore &amp; Sethome commands are provided for convenience.

 -&gt; Bartering Economy: There are no economy plugins, the server economy is based on trading with other players.

 -&gt; Large world: With a modest 300k overworld map &amp; 100k nether/end you are free to travel far out to build a base, or stay closer to spawn and experience the action.

 -&gt; Permanent Legacy: Our map is permanent and will never reset, so the monuments you build today will stand as a testament to your creativity for years to come.

 -&gt; TNT Duplication: Piston and slime based TNT dupers are enabled, which means you can build tree farms with ease or even create tnt machines of destruction.

Join sVanilla Survival and be a part of a community that honors the older style of sword based survival multiplayer. Welcome to sVanilla &amp; enjoy your minecraft!

Java,Unsure which direction to go in: infrastructure/systems or back-end/full-stack,"For a quick background, I graduated in 2020 with a BS in CS + math minor. Shortly after, I did 11 weeks of App Academy’s full-stack bootcamp (JavaScript/HTML/CSS, Ruby on Rails). Then I worked at TCS for 2 months that was basically training in Java, SQL, and microservices.

Then I got an offer from AWS and I worked there for about a year and 3 months on the EBS (Elastic Block Store, cloud storage for EC2 instances) encryption team. I did stuff like:

* Worldwide deployments and monitoring of encryption software updates to 100+ availability zones, including government regions.
* Worked on a Python CLI tool to speed up provisioning of encryption servers to reduce insufficient capacity problems.
* Wrote periodic metric collection code for the encryption codebase rewrite in Rust
* On-call shifts: root cause analysis, fixing errors, customer tickets, and maintaining encryption servers. So basically a mix of deployments, distributed systems code, tooling, and production maintenance.

After that, I did 4 months at a company called Pride Automation where I worked on their checklist web app (PrideView). Mostly front-end bug fixes in JavaScript/HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, and fixed a backend endpoint. Overall, this is about 2 years of experience, most of it at AWS.

I've been unemployed for nearly a year and a half at this point (largely due to uncomfortable hand symptoms, haven't sent out a large amount of applications). I’ve been doing online courses on Spring Boot, Java EE, Docker, React, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, building small full-stack projects, solving many LeetCode problems, and generally targeting full-stack or back-end roles.

My main question:  
After chatting with ChatGPT, it says my AWS experience aligns with mainly **infrastructure or systems software engineering**, and that my best chances are to get a job in that area, though my last day there was over 2.5 years ago. Is it correct and should I double down on this path, or should I keep aiming for back-end or full-stack? Both areas interest me, but I do want to have the best chance at landing a job.",cscareerquestions,2025-10-07T11:25:42,Reddit
Java,Anyone seeing better SEO results with Next.js or React vs WordPress?,"I’ve seen a lot of people using different site architecture latetly. Lots use WordPress, but I've been seeing lots using React or Next.js, and I’m curious how much the choice matters for SEO.

Are there real SEO advantages to using frameworks like Next.js over WordPress? Or is it mostly about performance and developer preference? I read before that Google has issues interpreting javascript sites but more and more I'm seeing sites with that tech at the top of Google. I always used to think that Wordpress was what Google preferred but I'm starting to think otherwise. 

1. Does Google still have any issues with JavaScript-heavy sites?

2. Is server-side rendering (SSR) or static generation (SSG) in Next.js noticeably better for SEO?

3. Do WordPress sites still have an edge when it comes to built-in SEO tools and easy optimization?",OnlineMarketing,2025-10-07T11:22:44,Reddit

Java,Seeking Guidance: Roadmap &amp; Tech Stack to Get Placed at Zoho,"Hi everyone,
I'm a Vajra  2rd year B.E  in CSE student, and my goal is to secure a software engineering position at Zoho. I really admire their work culture and product ecosystem.
 I'm trying to create a focused learning plan and would love some guidance from the community.

What I've Gathered So Far:
From what I've read online (Glassdoor, Reddit threads, etc.), it seems Zoho's process is unique:
Round 1: A written test heavily focused on C programming aptitude and problem-solving.
Later Rounds: Multiple rounds of programming, often involving building a small, functional application (like a simple library management system, etc.).
Core Languages: Java seems to be very prominent for their development roles.
Fundamentals: A very strong emphasis on Data Structures, Algorithms, and core CS concepts.

My Specific Questions:
Language Priority: Given their process, should I make Java my primary language? How proficient should I be? Is mastering Golang or Python also a viable path for their interviews?

DSA &amp; Problem Solving: How deep do I need to go with DSA? Is LeetCode-style grinding the best approach, or is it more about applying concepts to build something?

Project Portfolio: What kind of projects would impress Zoho recruiters? Should I focus on full-stack web applications, backend services with robust APIs, or something else? Does using a specific framework (like Spring for Java) add significant value?

Core CS Subjects: How much weightage is given to subjects like Operating Systems, DBMS (especially SQL), and Computer Networks in the interviews? Are theoretical questions common?

Preparing for the ""Application Round"": This seems to be the most challenging part. What's the best way to practice for this? Are there any resources or specific types of mini-projects you'd recommend building under time constraints?

Any advice, personal experiences (from current/former employees or interviewees), or useful resources would be incredibly helpful.

Thanks in advance for your time!",Zoho,2025-10-07T11:19:29,Reddit

Go,How Trump and Infantino's friendship is shaping the 2026 World Cup,"The plan started coming together inside a luxury box at MetLife Stadium.As the Premier League’s Chelsea was on its way to a shutout victory at the Club World Cup final in July, President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino were deep in discussion at the New Jersey sports complex outside New York City on another matter: where the draw for next year’s World Cup would be held.The high-drama spectacle decides which teams will face each other in the group stage of soccer’s most prestigious tournament, along with the schedule for competition. It was widely expected to unfold in Las Vegas, home to the 1994 draw when the U.S. last hosted the World Cup and a natural backdrop for glitz. But since at least March, officials had privately discussed bringing the draw to Washington, home to a showman president who regularly hugs the spotlight associated with sports. So during that July match in the stadium that will also host the final game of next year’s World Cup, Trump and Infantino agreed to get going on holding the draw in the U.S. capital — namely, the Kennedy Center, another institution that Trump reshaped to his liking.“During that Club World Cup final, there was a real seriousness to well, look, if we’re going to do this, we’ve got to do it now,” Andrew Giuliani, executive director of the White House FIFA task force, told The Associated Press. “That’s when talks heated up between the president and Mr. Infantino in terms of getting this done.”The collaboration over the draw, slated for Dec. 5, illustrates the bond that has formed between Trump and Infantino, described by the U.S. president as “probably the most respected man in sports.” The relationship will come into even sharper focus as the World Cup approaches, jointly hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Tickets are now open to fans as major questions hang over the tournament, including how welcome visitors from some countries will be in the U.S. amid its immigration crackdown. Even as the White House pledges openness, Trump has added another uncertainty by suggesting he could move games from cities he thinks are unsafe. Trump and Infantino develop a deep alliance Despite his affinity for sports, Trump is known more for his ties to golf and football than soccer. But his awareness of the sport was spurred in part by his youngest son, Barron, who is such a soccer fan that he had a net in the first lady’s garden during Trump’s first term.Trump’s interest only grew when the U.S. won World Cup hosting rights in 2018. Nothing excites Trump like hosting a major event, and Giuliani recalled that, at the time, the president and his aides were almost wistful that he wouldn’t be in the White House when the tournament arrived, assuming he would be well into a post-presidency following an immediate second term.Shortly after the U.S. was awarded the tournament, Trump hosted Infantino at the White House. Infantino, who was also serving his first term as FIFA president, made an impression by handing Trump red and yellow penalty cards, joking they could be used on the press. The relationship flourished in 2020 as both men plotted their futures. During a dinner that January at the global economic summit in Davos, near FIFA’s home in Zurich, Infantino called the U.S. president “my great friend.” Trump, always appreciative of a compliment, responded by inviting Infantino to a White House signing event for the Abraham Accords, which sought to normalize diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab countries. The ceremony happened as Infantino was aligning FIFA’s sporting and commercial ties with Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It followed a pattern of Infantino, much like Trump, cozying up to autocratic leaders.Infantino appeared to relish public meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin before, during and after that country hosted the 2018 World Cup. Visiting Putin at the Kremlin with a group of soccer greats during the tournament, Infantino said he felt “like a child in a toy shop” in Russia. He collected the Russian Order of Friendship from Putin the following year.Infantino would later relocate to Doha ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, emerging as a strong defender of the tiny Gulf state that was fiercely criticized for its treatment of the hundreds of thousands of migrant workers needed to build essential stadiums, transport projects and hotels.Infantino’s connections to Biden were far more limitedAs the connection between Trump and Infantino deepened, Joe Biden dashed Trump’s hopes of staying in the White House. For the next four years, Infantino’s ties to Washington were far more limited. The two leaders had a brief meeting on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022, a fleeting moment FIFA captured with one photo on its website.Second gentleman Douglas Emhoff also met with Infantino when he traveled for the Women’s World Cup in July 2023.Preparations for the World Cup under Biden were under the radar by design, according to one senior official for that administration who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Even though the administration had its own World Cup 2026 task force, Biden aides were aware of sensitivities surrounding large gatherings so soon after the COVID-19 pandemic.MORE WORLD CUP COVERAGE2026 World CupOct 1FIFA VP pushes back on Trump comments about moving World Cup games out of citiesWorld CupSep 26Trump suggests moving 2026 World Cup games out of U.S. cities he deems unsafeWorld CupSep 10Zohran Mamdani has new goal as he runs for NYC mayor: cheaper World Cup ticketsThe Biden White House was also careful not to overtly promote a relationship with FIFA, which had sidelined the U.S. Soccer Federation in its traditional role in coordinating a home World Cup. Instead, it negotiates individually with each of the 11 U.S. host cities on security, ticketing and other matters. Infantino visited the White House while Biden was president at least once, meeting for about an hour in 2024 with then-national security adviser Jake Sullivan, an avid soccer fan. Biden officials emphasized to Infantino that they wanted to ensure the host cities ultimately benefited from holding World Cup matches and that the U.S.’s human rights values would be respected.Trump’s return sets stage for a ‘MAGA’ World Cup Trump’s disappointment about missing out on the World Cup would prove to be unfounded after he was elected to a second, nonconsecutive term last year.Since that victory, Infantino’s embrace of Trump has been gushing. He promptly congratulated him the day after Election Day, was at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s South Florida club, during the presidential transition and had a prime seat at his January inauguration. Trump called Infantino a “winner” in a video played at the Miami draw for the Club World Cup in December, which was attended by daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.Meanwhile, FIFA has set up shop at Trump Tower in Manhattan, where Infantino worked last month as world leaders gathered nearby for the annual United Nations General Assembly. Infantino and Trump met again last week in New York, along with first lady Melania Trump, according to the FIFA president’s Instagram account. Infantino has teased the idea of Trump doing the draw himself, which Giuliani called the “MAGA-FIFA World Cup draw.” “Just like a great opera, there will be high drama,” Giuliani said. Infantino has had more public appearances with Trump than with any soccer officials from the sport’s heartlands of Europe and South America, according to the FIFA leader’s schedule and social media posts. He was late for his own FIFA Congress in Paraguay in May because he was with Trump and the Saudi crown prince in the Middle East, a move seen as disrespectful of his own voters and criticized by Europe’s soccer federations.During Infantino’s most recent appearance at Trump’s side in the Oval Office on Aug. 22, he took even some fellow soccer officials by surprise when he gifted a gold replica World Cup trophy to the U.S. president, saying it was “for winners only.” That handover was unexpected, according to one senior soccer official who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive dynamics. Even though it was a replica, the moment was still seen as a snub of World Cup tradition because Trump has held onto a trophy that is supposed to belong to the sport as a whole, not an individual person.A White House official said the trophy remains in the White House’s possession. No such offer was publicly extended by FIFA to Mexico’s President Claudia Scheinbaum or Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney. Infantino has not met with Carney this year and met Sheinbaum for the first time on Aug. 29.The episode is a reminder of how Infantino can shift with the moment. The man who remarked in Qatar on the eve of the World Cup in November 2022 that “today, I feel (like) a migrant worker” — comments interpreted as solidarity with migrants — was laughing along with Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem earlier this year as they bantered about migrants being unable to scale the repainted wall on the U.S. southern border.Infantino has framed his close relationship with Trump as “crucial” to the success of the World Cup, a massive operation that relies on expansive cooperation with federal, state and local governments. Trump’s suggestion that he could move the host cities was a reminder that Infantino is working with a famously impulsive president whose whims could expose FIFA to logistical havoc and legal jeopardy if he followed through. Even without those threats, those involved with World Cup planning said the tournament’s stakes are high because it’s the first in a series of global sporting events hosted by the U.S., including the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.“This needs to go well in order to show the world that if you want to have the best sports and entertainment events, you want to have them in the United States,” said Alex Lasry, CEO of the New York/New Jersey host committee. “I don’t think it’s unusual for a White House to be coordinating and be involved, and I don’t think it’s unusual for the heads of state and for the president to be excited and to be talking about a mega event coming here.”Dunbar reported from Geneva.",nbcphiladelphia,2025-10-06T18:39:21,NewsData

I had a less likely to be targeted and some decent long range spells. So I floated around shooting dark moons and sometimes crystal barrage while my Raider just shot arrows politely and took aggro. He kept dropping warming stones to recharge. I had given him my welding grace just in case because he’d probably be better at reviving me.

Go,Concerns about actions of executor,"My siblings and I are named in my grandfather’s will along with 2 aunts and my mother. The estate is supposed to be split between us. One of my aunts is the executor. 

My brother had organised to collect some furniture and belongings but the day before he had organised to be there she text him that she’d thrown it all out on the street. My brother ended up going through boxes of my grandfather’s belongings in the street in the rain but the furniture was gone, it was really upsetting. My understanding is the executor is supposed to create an inventory and isn’t allowed to just dispose of assets, is that right?

When my grandmother died, she left half of their property to my aunts, mother and and an uncle who died and left his portion to my cousin. They’ve owned 1/8 each of the property for about a decade but my grandfather lived there and paid all the strata fees, rates etc. My aunt is using the cash from my grandfather’s estate to renovate the property. They are contributing nothing but will benefit from the renovations doubly as they’re also inheriting my grandmother’s portion.

None of this seems right. What do I do, if anything?",AusLegal,2025-10-07T12:09:47,Reddit
Go,Candidate not engaging,"Before I go into detail I should mention we have a vacancy for a HR Admin in our team and are incredibly short staffed so there’s an urgent need to get someone in post asap. 

We made an offer for a HR Admin last week, I called the candidate to make a verbal offer, she sounded a little odd over the phone but she had mentioned she was on her way out, so I told her I would follow up with an email. 

An email was sent to the candidate shortly after the call reiterating that we wanted to offer her the HR Admin role and of course wanted to hear from her if she was happy to accept the offer or not. She confirmed her acceptance during the night, and the offer letter and details of pre-employment checks were sent to her quite early the next day. 

And then it was radio silence from the candidate, there was no acknowledgment of receipt of the offer letter or anything about the pre-employment checks. We sent a follow up and gave a deadline for response, she responded within that timeframe confirming she had read the offer letter and was happy to accept the offer on the terms outlined, and provided information to complete two of the pre employment checks (DBS and RTW) which were processed digitally. 

Days have gone by and we still haven’t heard from the candidate regarding her references.

Go,I don't know how to run,"I just DNF-ed my marathon yesterday. Up until the 20th km, I was trying my best to hold on to my pace, but I could no longer go any further and I was starting to feel so dizzy and my legs were giving up on me. I was fighting with myself to not give up and to just suck it up and continue the run, not giving a damn about timing or pace. But my body wasn't cooperating with me.

The marathon flag off was at 3:30am and the weather was hot and humid, it honestly felt very very hot for me, and 10km in, i was already sweating so much (I don't sweat as much on my usual runs), and my heart rate was unusually high for that pace. I knew in my heart something wasn't right, but I didnt care, I just kept going, trying to hold on for as long as I could. In the end I finally made the decision to stop because it was getting so bad, that I nearly passed out... my body just couldn't go any more. 

I'm glad I listened to my body and stopped, but the disappointment after was so bad, I couldn't even believe that after all the training block, all the long runs, and all the early mornings led up to this trash of a run. I kept wondering what went wrong, what's wrong with me?? I really don't know how..... and I don't even know how to attempt to run another marathon again...

Go,Negative Lyme Test but Severe Herxing,"I got what everyone believes to be a tick bite (I never actually saw a tick though) on September 30th. A large rash on my leg with some intense itching appeared about a week later. I went to urgent care and they put me on Doxy 100mg twice a day for 14 days. 

Doxy has felt fine until day 6. Then all of a sudden I felt intense aching in the leg with the bite. The following day, that aching spread pretty much everywhere. My neck, back, and legs have ALL been extremely achy, but I got a negative Lyme test and everything so I’m just surprised that I’m reacting this way. My rash though is basically healed which is great. 

I probably should be retested tbh, but I’m posting on this sub because yall are veterans and I could use advice about what to do going forward/what kind of doctor I should consult with.

Go,"Spirituality means balance, first of all.","These are my conclusions based on the feedback I've received throughout my life, while walking a spiritual path.

I often lived at the extremes with my thoughts, emotions, and actions. It was always harmful. Balance is something I chased for years. It didn’t begin by sheer will, but through healing myself over time and with patience. Now, it feels like a stable energy, subtle and refined.

How it changed me:

1. It stopped my need to compare myself to others.  
I realized that what I have, however small it may seem, is the result of my own work and I take pride in that. And I leave it at that, always.

2. It brought silence to my mind.  
Thoughts like “I’m stupid,” “I’m ugly,” “I didn’t study enough,” “I don’t earn enough for my age and knowledge,” or “I should avoid asking silly questions” became quieter and quieter.

3. I stopped caring about meaningless things.  
Brands, the desire to be rich, celebrities, watching TV, none of it matters to me anymore.

4. I started listening more.  
People express their pain in many ways, through all kinds of words and gestures. This helped me see the value in how people communicate.

5. I began speaking more clearly.  
To truly understand and connect with others, simple speech, pauses between ideas, and an appropriate tone are key. Using lofty words that sound like philosophical quotes or obscure labels from spiritual texts used to make people go quiet. Now, they come closer and ask questions. This shift played a big role in my transition from being closed-off to being open and relaxed.

6. I learned to filter what people say and “hear” the hidden issues.  
Sometimes people talk for 20 minutes with no real substance, just a need to be heard. Instead of responding to the surface level talk, I ask, “Okay, but may I ask what’s really bothering you?” That simple shift completely changed how people perceive me.

7. I became more sensitive to my surroundings.  
I started to sense what’s good or bad around me and learned to protect myself better, avoiding places with negative energy. Suddenly, after coming home from a pub or someone’s house, I wasn’t tired anymore.

8. This might sound funny, but my body language changed too.  
My shoulders are relaxed, my back is straight, I “stand tall,” as the saying goes. My gestures while speaking are calm and purposeful.  
Oh, and I’m not clumsy anymore. I haven’t spilled or dropped anything in a long time.

9. I defend myself, my ideas, and my beliefs in public.  
I’m no longer ashamed or afraid of being judged. I speak my mind without trying to convince anyone. I also easily avoid arguments.

10. Time feels different.  
My awareness has increased and continues to grow. I often play with time by setting an intention and choosing to “go slower.” The result? I get more done, faster, without feeling rushed. I’m still studying this phenomenon, it’s hard to explain, so I treat it like homework.

There’s more, but the essence remains: I am and feel more balanced in everything.  
This doesn’t mean I’m perfect or closer to being “enlightened.” I’m still me… just a different me. A better me.

By the way, how’s your balance these days?",spirituality,2025-10-07T12:09:21,Reddit

Go,Need help identifying a shirt,"About 5 or 6 years ago I was in a thrift store in California &amp; found this shirt, it was a bit big for me but I bought it cause it was comfy and had these nice side pockets on it to store stuff. Now it's falling apart in the pits and the pockets are breaking. It has no tags or identifiable information on it. Everywhere else I go to has no information on this type of shirt so I decided I'll ask the internet. If you have any info that might help me figure out what it is and how I can find a new one, it'd be greatly appreciated.

It is the community run successor to LibreFox. LibreWolf is designed to increase protection against tracking and fingerprinting techniques, while also including a few security improvements. This is achieved through our privacy and security oriented settings and patches. LibreWolf also aims to remove all the telemetry, data collection and annoyances, as well as disabling anti-freedom features like DRM. LibreWolf features: Latest Firefox — LibreWolf is compiled directly from the latest build of Firefox Stable. You will have the the latest features, and security updates.Independent Build — LibreWolf uses a build independent of Firefox and has its own settings, profile folder and installation path. As a result, it can be installed alongside Firefox or any other browser.No phoning home — Embedded server links and other calling home functions are removed. In other words, minimal background connections by default.User settings updatesExtensions firewall: limit internet access for extensions.Multi-platform (Windows/Linux/Mac/and soon Android)Community-DrivenDark theme (classic and advanced)LibreWolf privacy features: Delete cookies and website data on close.Include only privacy respecting search engines like DuckDuckGo and Searx.Include uBlockOrigin with custom default filter lists, and Tracking Protection in strict mode, to block trackers and ads.Strip tracking elements from URLs, both natively and through uBO.Enable dFPI, also known as Total Cookie Protection.Enable RFP which is part of the Tor Uplift project. RFP is considered the best in class anti-fingerprinting solution, and its goal is to make users look the same and cover as many metrics as possible, in an effort to block fingerprinting techniques.Always display user language as en-US to websites, in order to protect the language used in the browser and in the OS.Disable WebGL, as it is a strong fingerprinting vector.Prevent access to the location services of the OS, and use Mozilla's location API instead of Google's API.Limit ICE candidates generation to a single interface when sharing video or audio during a videoconference.Force DNS and WebRTC inside the proxy, when one is being used.Trim cross-origin referrers, so that they don't include the full URI.Disable link prefetching and speculative connections.Disable disk cache and clear temporary files on close.Disable form autofill.Disable search and form history...and more.Notes: To receive automatic updates, you may refer to the unofficial LibreWolf-WinUpdater that employs a scheduled task to accomplish the same.

Linux,Memetic takeover by UNIX:  Entropy Attractor Intelligence Paradigm narrative about UNIX success,"***“…UNIX evolves not as a “true” OS but as an admissible morphism stack sustaining syntax-semantics mappings under entropy budgets.”***

I am the executive doing all the systems thinking and strategic thinking. Using my 35-year experience at the University of the Philippines, I am also the creator/developer — with help from company colleagues — of the model involved, Bridge360 Metatheory Model. LLM1, LLM2, LLM3, LLM4, and LLM5 are the rank and file clerks serving as interlocutors showing me information I have little or no time to access. \[ChatGPT (LLM1), Gemini (LLM2), Perplexity (LLM3), Claude (LLM4), Grok (LLM5)\]



https://preview.redd.it/o4g9d473xmtf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1ebf9ae99d85c3462ba31b39de6306e47836121

My prompt issued to LLM1 as I upload two documents elaborating Bridge360 Metatheory Model:

Map predictions beginning (with) work of Ken Thomson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1969 to the present tracking the development of UNIX and how it has become memetic over all ICT spaces now using Bridge360 Metatheory Model and see if the actual historical events fit the predictions in some retrodictive validation form.

LLM1 response:

Here’s a compact “Bridge360 retrodictive audit” of UNIX from Thompson–Ritchie (1969) to today. Each row states what Bridge360 would have **predicted** ex-ante (given its ε-band, fragility cap, and braid-and-bus norms), then checks the **historical fit**.

&gt;

# UNIX through the Bridge360 lens — predicted vs. observed

https://preview.redd.it/c13xmvxqvmtf1.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30e1dff6e3a3f62c82167bf693fee85c258e5e76

# Why this is a memetic takeover (in Bridge360 terms)

* **Consensus spine:** C/POSIX/Unix shell formed the thin, low-rank bus that everyone could target (compile once, script everywhere). That’s exactly the “braid-then-bus” admissibility pattern.
* **ε-band discipline:** The text-first, tool-chain approach sits in the **mid-entropy** corridor—expressive enough (not too brittle), simple enough (not chaotic).
* **Tripwire avoidance:** When centralization risked chokepoints (single vendor UNIX), the ecosystem morphed via open standards and licensing (POSIX, BSD/GNU/Linux)—a textbook repair path to keep F ≤ 0.40.
* **Event-triggered fusion:** Cloud/container orchestration (Kubernetes) braided many local spines (apps, services, clusters) into a controlled bus only where shared structure existed, keeping slack local.

# Retrodictive validation scorecard

* **1969–1983 (Birth → BSD/TCP/IP):** Strong fit. Pipes + C + sockets show the **same** entropy-bounded design choices B360 would recommend. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **1984–1995 (Standards &amp; governance realignment):** Strong fit. POSIX and the BSD unencumbering reduce coordination entropy; Linux completes the free UNIX stack. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([Fossbytes](https://fossbytes.com/linus-torvaldss-famous-email-first-linux-announcement/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **1996–2010 (Consumer &amp; web expansion):** Strong fit. Apache-era web + Apple’s Darwin (BSD/Mach) propagate the meme into browsers and desktops. ([WIRED](https://www.wired.com/1999/05/apache-3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **2011–today (Cloud/HPC/mobile ubiquity):** Very strong fit. Android’s Linux kernel, Kubernetes, and Linux-everywhere in HPC reflect a stable, low-fragility consensus spine. ([Android Open Source Project](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/kernel?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

# Bottom line (Bridge360 verdict)

UNIX’s history **fits** Bridge360’s predictions with high fidelity: a thin, portable **consensus spine** (C/POSIX/shell) operating in the ε-band with fragility capped—then **braided** upward (Internet, cloud, mobile) only where the shared structure lowered net entropy. That’s classic **entropy-bounded mapping** rather than “truth” claims, and it explains the meme’s extraordinary reach across ICT.

…

My prompt issued to LLM5 as I upload two documents elaborating Bridge360 Metatheory Model:

Map predictions using Bridge360 Metatheory Model beginning with work (of) Ken Thomson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1969 to the present tracking the development of UNIX and how it has become memetic over all ICT spaces now and see if the actual historical events fit the predictions in some retrodictive validation form.

LLM5 response:

Historical Timeline of UNIX Development and Memetic Spread

To retrodictively validate the Bridge360 Metatheory Model against the evolution of UNIX, we first construct a compressed timeline as a “local spine” summary (per H.4.x Consensus-Spine Admissibility). This fuses key events into a thin meta-spine (S\*), capturing consensus modes: modular design, portability, and philosophical propagation (”do one thing well,” text as universal interface). The timeline tracks from inception (1969) to the present (October 2025), emphasizing entropy-stabilizing morphisms (e.g., rewrites, forks) and memetic braiding across ICT domains (servers, embedded systems, AI tooling).

Notes on Proxies: ε-hat retrodictively estimated as H(π\_T)/log|S| where π\_T is induced distribution over system states (e.g., version forks), S as relevant configs (tools/interfaces). F as fragility proxy (e.g., litigation density or outage rates). All stay within gates: ε ∈ \[0.45, 0.65\], F ≤ 0.40, per Axiom E. Distortion D(full || T) ≤ B via budgeted idealizations (e.g., text interfaces defer GUI complexity).

Bridge360 Mapping: UNIX as Entropy-Bounded Navigability Scaffold

Under Bridge360 (v16.3 Light-Spine Integration), UNIX evolves not as a “true” OS but as an admissible morphism stack sustaining syntax-semantics mappings under entropy budgets. The core “light-spine” (Axiom L) is the null-like causal order of its philosophy: modular, text-pipelined flows (pipes as null generators k\^a, preserving order without bloating h). Development and memetic spread operationalize the Braid-then-Bus Pattern (H.4.x), fusing local spines (e.g., Thompson’s assembler tools) into a thin meta-spine S (kernel + shell ecosystem) via event-triggered sync (e.g., USENIX conferences, mailing lists).

Key Morphisms as Entropic Handoffs (EMS, Section 4)

Tripwires fired sparingly (e.g., Y2K as h ↑ test, resolved by patches; 2024–2025 quantum threats audited via post-quantum libs in FreeBSD/Linux). Repair paths: Always escalate minimally (e.g., add damping via standards), retest gates.

Linux,Logitech mx master 3s - can't save customizations - disappointed,"I got mx master 3s on discount last Sunday, it's on clearing because mx master 4 is coming. This is my first experience with a productivity focused mouse, I have to say it feels great though, like far better than the corporate issued one. 

what I can't accept is that it doesn't have memory, all customized settings are saved in an app called options+, you uninstall it all settings revert to default. So pretty much it means I just bought a productivity mouse that I can't even use properly on my corporate laptop or my own PC (which runs linux), so far it only works out my Mac which I don't even use for work.

I never thought this is an issue, since I also have a Logitech g502, a gaming mouse, I customize the keys and uninstall the app, all settings are kept as is. Now I wanna know why does Logitech think it's OK not to persist settings for their productivity mouse, given they definitely can do it.

Also the app is quite annoying, you have to keep it running in the background and it requires a range of permissions like spying on hardware interfaces on activities in other apps. Does mx master 4 have onboard memory? if so I probably consider an exchange.",logitech,2025-10-07T11:46:00,Reddit

Rust,Non-'static arguments in async peripheral drivers?,"This is my first time implementing a driver in Rust and I'm pretty new to async so please excuse any misunderstandings! Concretely, I'm implementing a driver that'll feed data into a peripheral's ring buffer with an ISR. So far I've implemented something like this:

```
async fn transmit(
    self: &amp;mut EnsureExclusivePeripheralAccess,
    data: impl Iterator + Send
) {
    statically_store_ref_dyn_iterator_for_isr_to_use(unsafe{transmute(&amp;data)});
    initiate_transmit();
    wait_for_isr().await
}
```


However, it occurs to me that my future may be _dropped_ (even though it can't be _moved_ since it must be `Pin`ed to be run) before the ISR is done, invalidating the iterator that the ISR is still using. Am I correct that that's possible? If so, I think you'd need some way to statically store the iterator itself and, moreover, a `'static` bound on the iterator (`data: Iterator + Send + 'static`) to make this API safe?

Would you have any suggestions for an API that is safe but doesn't require the iterator to be 'static? I imagine you could, somehow, for example, heap allocate the iterator and its backing data, and use runtime checking to ensure that the ISR is complete before releasing it back to the caller...

Rust,"10 Best Outdoor Pizza Ovens That Deliver Crispy, Restaurant-Quality Pizzas","# The Anatomy of the Perfect Pizza: What Makes Outdoor Ovens Stand Out

When talking about pizza, especially the kind that elevates outdoor gatherings, the oven you choose plays a critical role in the final outcome. Outdoor pizza ovens have gained popularity for good reason—their unique designs and features result in crispy, delicious pizzas that rival any restaurant. Understanding what makes these ovens stand out can help you select the best one for your needs, making your backyard pizzas truly unforgettable.

At the heart of any great outdoor pizza oven is its ability to reach and maintain high temperatures. Traditional home ovens typically reach only around 500°F, while top-quality outdoor ovens can soar to about 900°F. This high heat is essential for the perfect crust. It allows the dough to cook quickly and become beautifully charred on the outside while remaining soft and chewy on the inside.

Another factor that differentiates outdoor pizza ovens is their cooking surface. Most of these ovens come equipped with a stone or ceramic baking surface, which absorbs heat exceptionally well. This feature helps to create a crispier crust by drawing out moisture from the dough. Here are a few materials commonly used:

* **Firebrick:** Excellent heat retention and durability.
* **Cast Iron:** Provides a diverse range of cooking styles and is extremely durable.
* **Cordierite Stone:** Known for its thermal stability and ability to produce excellent crusts.

Portability is another standout feature of many outdoor pizza ovens. Depending on their design, some ovens are lightweight and easy to move, making it convenient for spontaneous gatherings or parties. If you’re someone who likes to cook outdoors in different locations, investing in a portable model can be a game-changer.

Fuel types are also a critical element when considering which outdoor pizza oven to purchase. The most common fuel sources include wood, charcoal, gas, and electricity. Each type offers distinct flavors and functionalities:

* **Wood-fired:** Infuses a smoky flavor into the pizza and reaches high temperatures quickly.
* **Charcoal:** Provides a more traditional BBQ flavor and offers intense heat.
* **Gas:** Easy to control temperatures, making it user-friendly and consistent.
* **Electric:** Convenient for those who prefer less mess; however, they often don't reach the same high temperatures as wood or gas ovens.

The shape and design of the oven can significantly impact heat distribution and cooking times. Domed ovens, for instance, circulate heat evenly, which is why they are favored by many pizza enthusiasts. The design encourages a consistent cooking environment, ensuring that your pizza cooks evenly without any hot spots.

Another key feature to consider is the cooking method. Outdoor ovens often allow for multiple cooking techniques, including roasting and baking. This versatility means you can not only make pizzas but also enjoy delicious roasted vegetables and meats, adding added value to your investment.

For those who enjoy customizing flavors, outdoor ovens often have the capability for adjusting air flow and heat intensity. Being able to control these elements allows you to experiment with different styles of pizza, ensuring that your culinary creativity through the outdoor oven knows no bounds.

Ease of use and maintenance plays a vital role in the overall experience of using an outdoor pizza oven. Many models provide straightforward setups and require minimal cleaning, which means you have more time to enjoy your food and company rather than dealing with complicated equipment. Features like removable ash trays, durable surfaces, and accessible propane tanks can streamline your cooking experience.

Choosing the right outdoor pizza oven is a matter of understanding your specific needs and preferences. With the myriad of options available, each feature contributes to creating that perfect pizza. Remember—the journey to a crispy, restaurant-quality pizza starts with the right equipment, and an outdoor pizza oven can be your ticket to achieving culinary success right in your backyard.

# Essential Features to Look for in Outdoor Pizza Ovens

When selecting the perfect outdoor pizza oven, it's important to know what features to look for to ensure you're making a wise investment. The right oven can deliver crispy, restaurant-quality pizzas, transforming your backyard into a gourmet dining experience. Below are essential features to consider when shopping for an outdoor pizza oven.

# Heat Source

Outdoor pizza ovens generally operate on three types of heat sources: wood, gas, and electricity. Each has its advantages:

* **Wood-Fired:** Offers a traditional flavor and excellent heat retention, making it ideal for achieving crispy crusts.
* **Gas:** Provides quick heating, great temperature control, and ease of use, perfect for those who want convenience.
* **Electric:** Usually best for smaller spaces and offers consistent heating, but may not reach the high temperatures needed for gourmet pizzas.

# Temperature Range

The temperature is crucial for making authentic pizzas. Look for an oven that can reach at least 700°F to 900°F. This high temperature allows for a quick cooking time of about 60 to 90 seconds, giving you that perfectly blistered crust.

# Size and Capacity

Before purchasing, consider how many pizzas you want to make at once. Some ovens have a capacity for one pizza at a time, while others can handle two or more. If you're hosting larger gatherings, choose an oven with a bigger cooking surface. Additionally, ensure it fits your outdoor space comfortably.

# Portability

If you plan to move your oven around your yard or take it on camping trips, portability is key. Look for an oven that is lightweight and comes with wheels or handles for easy transport. Some outdoor pizza ovens are even compact enough to be easily stored away when not in use.

# Material and Build Quality

The materials used in the construction of your pizza oven will greatly affect its durability and heat retention. Stainless steel ovens often resist rust and corrosion, while brick or stone ovens can provide excellent insulation. Regardless of material, ensure the build quality feels sturdy and reliable.

# Insulation

Good insulation is crucial for retaining heat and achieving optimal cooking results. Double-walled construction or ceramic insulation can significantly improve heat retention, allowing for consistent cooking temperatures even when the oven opens and closes.

# Ease of Cleaning

Cooking pizza can get messy, so consider how easy the oven is to clean. Features like removable ash trays or accessible oven interiors can make maintenance a breeze. Opt for models with surfaces that can be easily wiped down and materials that resist staining.

# Temperature Control

Having accurate temperature control can help you manage the cooking process better. Look for models with built-in thermometers or adjustable vents, allowing you to fine-tune the heat based on the type of pizza you are making.

# Accessories

A good outdoor pizza oven often comes with various accessories that can enhance your cooking experience. Here are some useful add-ons:

* **Pizza Stone:** This helps in maintaining heat and creating that desired crispy crust.
* **Pizza Peel:** A flat paddle that helps you place and remove pizzas safely.
* **Cover:** A protective cover can prolong the life of your oven by shielding it from the elements when not in use.

# Price

Outdoor pizza ovens come in a wide price range. Affordable options may lack some features, but they can still deliver good cooking results. Be sure to balance your budget with the features that matter most to you. Investing a bit more on a high-quality oven can enhance your outdoor cooking experience.

By considering these essential features, you can make an informed decision when choosing the best outdoor pizza oven for your needs. Whether you're a casual pizza lover or a budding chef, this investment will surely elevate your outdoor culinary adventures, making it easy to enjoy crispy, restaurant-quality pizzas right at home.

# Comparing Fuel Types: Wood, Gas, and Electric Outdoor Pizza Ovens

Here's a closer look at these fuel types to help you make the best decision for your outdoor cooking style.

Learn more about the [**Best Pizza Oven**](https://easy5ingredientmeals.com/12-best-pizza-ovens-for-every-budget-affordable-mid-range-pro-picks/)

  


# Wood-Fired Pizza Ovens

Wood-fired pizza ovens are often regarded as the gold standard for homemade pizzas. They deliver that crispy, smoky flavor that many pizza enthusiasts love. The main characteristics of wood-fired ovens include:

* **Flavor:** Cooking with wood infuses a rich, smoky taste that gas and electric options can't replicate. The wood type (like oak, hickory, or cherry) can further enhance the flavor profile.
* **High Heat:** These ovens can reach temperatures of up to 900°F, making them perfect for quickly baking pizzas in a matter of minutes.
* **Cooking Technique:** Users must master the art of controlling the fire, which can take some practice. This hands-on experience can be charming for those who love the traditional method.
* **Maintenance:** Cleaning ash and maintaining the fire might be more labor-intensive compared to other options.

A wood-fired pizza oven offers a delightful experience, especially if you’re inclined towards traditional methods. If you enjoy the interactive process of cooking and the smokey flavor it provides, this may be the ideal choice for you.

# Gas Pizza Ovens

Gas pizza ovens have gained popularity for their convenience and efficiency. They provide a reliable heat source and are generally easier to operate than wood-fired ovens. Here are some key aspects to consider:

* **Convenience:** Just turn on the gas, and your oven is ready to cook in minutes. This is great for those who want to enjoy pizza without the hassle of managing a wood fire.
* **Temperature Control:** Gas ovens allow for precise temperature settings, making it easier to achieve consistent results.
* **Clean-Up:** With no ash or embers to deal with, cleaning up after cooking is straightforward.
* **Versatility:** Many gas ovens can also be used for grilling and baking other dishes, providing more value.

If you’re looking for a straightforward and efficient way to make delicious pizzas with minimal fuss, a gas pizza oven is an excellent choice. It combines the ability to reach high temperatures with ease of use.

# Electric Pizza Ovens

Electric pizza ovens offer an alternative for those who may not have the outdoor space or inclination to deal with wood or gas. Here’s what you need to know:

* **Ease of Use:** Simply plug it in, set the temperature, and wait for it to preheat. This is ideal for beginners or those with limited outdoor cooking experience.
* **Safety:** Electric ovens don’t produce an open flame, making them a safe option for families with kids.
* **Portability:** Many electric models are lightweight and portable, allowing you to move them around your garden or even take them on camping trips.
* **Cooking Time:** Although they don’t reach as high temperatures as wood-fired ovens, many electric models can still deliver great results, especially for thin-crust pizzas.

Electric pizza ovens are perfect for cooks who prioritize convenience and safety over the intense flavors generated by wood-fired ovens. If you're short on space or want a hassle-free option, this may be the way to go.

Choosing the right fuel type for your outdoor pizza oven really boils down to your cooking style and preferences. Whether you lean towards the classic flavors of wood, the convenience of gas, or the accessibility of electric, each option has unique benefits that can enhance your pizza-making experience. Understanding these differences will assist you in selecting an oven that not only meets your culinary needs but also aligns with your lifestyle. With the right outdoor pizza oven, you’ll be on your way to making crispy, restaurant-quality pizzas right in your own backyard.

# Maintenance Tips for Extending the Life of Your Outdoor Pizza Oven

Maintaining your outdoor pizza oven is crucial for ensuring it lasts for years while delivering amazing, crispy pizzas every time. With just a little effort, you can keep your oven in top shape and ready for your next pizza night. Here are some handy tips to help you extend the life of your outdoor pizza oven.

# Regular Cleaning

To prevent buildup of grease and food particles, always clean your outdoor pizza oven after each use. Here is a simple cleaning routine:

* Wait for the oven to cool down.
* Use a soft brush or cloth to remove ashes and debris from the cooking surface.
* For stubborn spots, use a mixture of water and mild soap, then wipe with a damp cloth.
* Don’t forget to clean the exterior to keep your oven looking great!

# Check for Damage

Regularly inspecting your pizza oven can help you catch any potential problems before they worsen. Look out for:

* Crumbling bricks or damaged stone surfaces.
* Cuts or tears in the insulation material.
* Signs of rust on metal components.

If you notice any damage, it's best to address it promptly to avoid bigger issues later on.

# Maintain Adequate Ventilation

Proper airflow is crucial for achieving the right cooking temperature. Ensure that vents are not blocked and are functioning correctly. You can enhance ventilation by:

* Clearing any buildup around the vent areas.
* Making sure the chimney is unobstructed for smoke to escape effectively.

Good ventilation not only improves cooking efficiency but also reduces excess heat on the oven’s structure.

# Use the Right Fuel

Using quality fuel is key to prolonging the lifespan of your pizza oven. Depending on your oven type, consider:

* For wood-fired ovens, choose well-seasoned hardwood for a cleaner burn.
* For gas ovens, ensure your propane tank is in good condition and that connections are tight to prevent leaks.

Quality fuel can help reduce soot buildup and unwanted wear on your oven's components.

# Protect from the Elements

Your outdoor pizza oven is exposed to various weather conditions, which can wear it down over time. To protect it, you should:

* Invest in a durable, weather-resistant cover to shield the oven when not in use.
* Locate your pizza oven in a sheltered area, away from direct rain or extreme wind.

A little extra protection can go a long way in extending the life of your oven.

# Season Your Oven

Just like cast iron pans, pizza ovens can benefit from seasoning. Seasoning helps to create a non-stick layer on the cooking surface and prevents rust. Regularly ""season"" your oven by:

* Running your oven at a high temperature with some oil spread over the cooking surface.
* Letting it cool down, repeating this process every few uses.

This simple addition to your maintenance routine enhances your oven's cooking performance while also adding longevity.

# Store Properly During Off-Seasons

When not in use, especially during winter months, proper storage is essential. Here are some steps to consider:

* Cover with a breathable material to prevent moisture buildup.
* Ensure all components, such as the chimney, are securely fastened or removed.

Proper off-season storage helps prevent damage from extreme temperatures or moisture.

# Follow the Manufacturer’s Guidelines

Always refer to the owner’s manual for your specific pizza oven model. Each oven may have unique features or maintenance recommendations that should be followed closely. Pay attention to:

* Specific cleaning techniques recommended for your oven’s materials.
* Instructions for replacing parts that may wear out over time.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure your oven remains in good shape, delivering delicious meals for years to come. Maintaining your outdoor pizza oven may seem daunting at times, but with these tips, you can make it a simple, regular part of your routine. By keeping your oven clean, protected, and well-cared-for, you’ll be set for countless evenings filled with perfectly baked pizzas.

# Conclusion

When it comes to creating the perfect pizza experience right in your backyard, understanding the unique features of outdoor pizza ovens is vital. Each oven has its own anatomy, designed to deliver that crispy, restaurant-quality crust that we all crave. Whether you’re drawn to the traditional appeal of wood-fired ovens, the convenience of gas, or the ease of electric models, knowing the essential features to look for can make all the difference in your cooking experience.

Rust,Why isn't the pin on my adjustable dumbbells working?,"Hey fitness friends! I've been dealing with a super frustrating issue with my adjustable dumbbells lately, and I figured I'd share my experience and solutions since I know many of you probably face the same problem.

So here's the deal - I recently got these amazing adjustable dumbbells from https://athometouch.com/adjustable-dumbbells and while they're generally fantastic, I started having issues with the pin mechanism. You know that annoying moment when you try to adjust the weight, but the selector pin just won't budge? Yeah, that.

After some research and trial-and-error, I discovered several reasons why this happens:

1. Dirt and Debris
The most common culprit is actually dust and small particles getting stuck in the mechanism. I found that regular cleaning with a slightly damp cloth and keeping them off the floor makes a huge difference.

2. Misalignment
Sometimes the plates aren't sitting perfectly flush. When this happens, I've learned to slightly wiggle the dumbbell while it's on the base, making sure everything lines up properly before trying to move the pin.

3. Storage Issues
Keeping them in humid areas can cause rust, which affects the pin mechanism. I moved mine away from my basement workout area to a dryer spot, and it helped tremendously.

Here's what worked for me to fix these issues:

- Regular maintenance (weekly quick wipe-down)
- Using a tiny bit of WD-40 (but be super careful not to overdo it)
- Always returning weights to the base gently
- Double-checking alignment before attempting to change weights

If you're in the market for new adjustable dumbbells or considering an upgrade, I highly recommend checking out these ones: https://athometouch.com/adjustable-dumbbells. They're really well-made and come with great customer support if you do run into any issues.

Quick maintenance tip: After each workout, I spend about 30 seconds just making sure the mechanism is clean and moving smoothly. This small habit has prevented most problems from occurring in the first place.

Remember, these are precision tools, even though they're built tough. Treating them with a bit of care goes a long way in preventing pin issues and extending their life.

Let me know if you've tried any of these solutions or if you have other tips to share. I'm always looking to learn more about maintaining my home gym equipment!",AtHomeEssentials,2025-10-07T11:48:33,Reddit

Rust,NOLL: Raid Stories fic: A Hunter From New England Wild,"MEMORY TRANSCRIPTION SUBJECT: Ebenezer Linus Van Parrish, eccentric member of the idle rich and retired bounty hunter

It had been an auspicious day for the lizards to raid Wilks Valley, or indeed to walk the streets of Brantford, New Hampshire, nestled within like the crown jewels of the Queen.

It was the 31^(st) anniversary of...of the accident.

My brother Samuel and I had been drinking, and we had decided to try and recapture our youths by going out for a joyride in his Maserati Ghibli.

My memories are fragmented: getting behind the wheel. Gesticulating while talking with Samuel.

Then a bright light and an earth-shattering noise.

Nothing as...*unusual* as abduction of course...we had been struck side-on by an 18-wheeler.

He…

He didn't make it.

I'd never had the head for business, so I left the running of Van Parrish Industries to his mother Carol Pelt nee Van Parrish, my sister in law. She'd always had the head for numbers that I lacked, and she had run the company well, but…

She died.

Lung cancer.

Her tobacco habit and overworking, trying to be both mother and manager...it killed her.

My nephew Alan blamed me for the accident that left his mother a single mother, and for ruining the family's fortune.

Sometimes, after a few glasses of gin, the walls I have built convincing myself it's *not all my fault* crumble like the walls of Rome under the assault of the savage Visigoths.

And I *weep*.

I couldn't...I *can't* stand to lose what remains of my family, even if Alan (rightly) blamed me for it all...

It may sound odd, but we found reconciliation on that battlefield.

MEMORY TRANSCRIPTION SUBJECT: Alan Van Parrish

I had been...talking with Uncle Eb. He'd just sort of...shown up.

I'm honestly ashamed to admit it...but I'd been about to start yelling when-

**CRASH!**

An Arxur smashed through the downstairs bay window.

I didn't know it was an Arxur, I thought it was just some meth head, so I decided to go and try and settle things peacefully.

Uncle Eb immediately went for the gun safe and grabbed my great-grandfather's custom elephant gun, an old Winchester 1901 with a rifled barrel, rechambered in...I think it was black powder 12 bore elephant gun cartridges.

I ran downstairs to try and tell the guy to leave before my *crazy uncle* blew his head off.

I rounded the corner of the downstairs entryway into the living room, and stopped dead. Saying I was *incredibly* confused at what I saw is drastically understating it (Bear in mind, I'd never seen an Arxur before, so I'd wondered, briefly, if someone had slipped LSD into my morning coffee.)

""Ah, fresh meat!""

It spread its claws.

*Whuh huh?*

In that moment of confusion, the Arxur leapt on me, biting into my arm.

*It fucking hurt!*

The scaly bastard knocked me into a shelf, sending antique tchotchkes and books and Great-Great-Grandfather Angus Van Parrish's cavalry saber falling to the ground as I slid down the side, trying to grab on to something, *anything*, to break my fall.

**KSHHH!**

The glass display case shattered on the floor, and I seized the chance.

I stabbed the lizard in the mouth with a piece of glass, then grabbed the saber and hit the Arxur on the head with it.

I should...probably have removed the sheath first.

Thankfully, the one-two combo gave me the space I needed to crawl away, before-

**BOOM!**

**Thud!**

The Arxur's head disintegrated into a red mist and a rain of bone splinters, many of which embedded themselves in the Colonial paneling. The parquet floor. The ceiling.

*Oh God...*

I looked behind me to see Uncle Eb on the downstairs landing, lowering a smoking gun.

""Are you alright?...Dear God, you're *bleeding*, boy! Where do you keep the first-aid?""

*Guess Uncle Eb does care…*

""...Above the fridge.""

\[TRANSCRIPTION NOTICE: TIME SKIP OF 2 HOURS\]

MEMORY TRANSCRIPTION SUBJECT: Ebenezer Linus Van Parrish (Highly accomplished oldster who's about to add ""alien hunter"" to his resume)

*Well, I think this reunion went swimmingly.*

**Ch-Chak!**

**BOOM!**

**Ch-Chak!**

**BOOM!**

After that reptilian ruffian's cohorts had showed their besnouted faces, I had shot a further two as they entered the house through various unorthodox means, urged my nephew to grab a gun from the safe, and then stepped outside.

I found three more standing over the corpse of a postal worker, *eating* the corpse.

**Ch-Chak!**

**BOOM!**

**Ch-Chak!**

**BOOM!**

**Ch-Chak!**

My face wrinkling in disgust, I fired twice more, demolishing two of the bounders before the third threw some form of blade at me. It smashed the window of the rental Mercedes I had arrived in instead.

**KRSH!**

**BOOM!**

**HONK! HONK! HONK! HONK!**

Dodging quickly to the side as I had threw off my aim somewhat, and it *just* missed the larcenous lizard's ""gentleman area"" by a whisker.

The lizard broke and ran then.

**CLICK!**

*Blast, out of ammunition.*

""YOU MISERABLE COWARD! COME BACK AND FACE ME LIKE A MAN!""

I know not if the lizard heard me, the car alarm was rather deafening.

Alan joined me on my excursion. He had tied an improvised sling from scraps of the bay window curtains, to hold the saber in its sheath close to his body.

*Excellent.* ~~Perhaps through death I can find redemption~~

Near the graveyard on Adams Street, we encountered a crashed vehicle (an old Subaru Brat) with the driver and all passengers dead. It would appear that the vehicle rolled over and crushed everyone inside.

~~Their bodies were twisted and bloody like Sam's was, their splintered bones jutting from their flesh~~

I interrupted my spiral with a quick swig from my hip flask, and set to.

We made our way to a nearby gun store on 12^(th) and Leavitt, where I discovered they apparently didn't *sell* the necessary ammunition for the elephant gun, which was long out of production.

To be perfectly honest...fair enough. It's a custom rifle in an obscure antique caliber that was long obsolete even when grandfather Ulysses commissioned the piece. So I purchased a replacement weapon, a modified surplus M14 EBR marksman rifle with an integral suppressor and night-vision scope, and Alan purchased an…

*Oh.*

At first I thought that he'd wasted his money on a common M8 flare gun of all things, a surplus of the war against the Nazis, but *then* I observed its...*unorthodox* modifications.

I was...hesitant to ask where the manic-eyed young man in the gun store got it, or why it had been modified with a new custom barrel to accept *40mm grenades*...or why he asked to be paid in gold (a condition which I gladly acquiesced to under the understanding that Alan would pay me back in bills), but...I had to admit it would be quite useful.

Alan and I left the store.

""I didn't know you cared…""

*Oh Alan…*

I took a deep, fortifying breath.

""I...I suppose I owe you an apology for my distance throughout the years.""

Alan looked intrigued.

*I...I really am a bastard...*

""I…I suppose, deep down, I am but a miserable *coward*. I bury myself in roleplay of an era long past, I take up a *bounty hunting job* like some common scoundrel to roleplay as a hunter of men, I even *restructure my speech patterns* around 19^(th) century norms...but I…""

*Come on Ebenezer, keep your chin up. Come on, keep your chin up. Crying never helped anybody do anything, okay? You have a problem, you face it like a man...*

""Uncle Eb?""

*Alan is still concerned for me, even after all I have caused...*

""I...I…""

After an uncomfortable silence, I confessed.

""It's all my fault…I'm the reason Samue-...*Sam* is dead…""

**CRASH!**

My emotional spiral was interrupted by the sound of a 20-year-old Toyota Corolla roaring past us two, traveling at upwards of 90 miles per hour.

**Szr-r-r-r-r-rt!**

An old Honda N600 stalled on the other side of the street, and the owner got out and *bolted.*

At the end of the street, I saw lizards in some kind of...what was it called...*dune buggy* round the corner, before a 1974 Mercury Cougar with sizable rust spots struck it side on ~~like the 18 wheeler~~…

**Clang!**

...And the subframe fell out from the bottom of the car, taking the engine with it.

Some lizards swarmed the driver, others saw *us* and called reinforcements.

*Many* others showed their fanged snouts and ran for us.

""They're coming, Alan. Get ready.""

I raised my rifle.

Alan raised the ancestral saber in one hand and his new grenade pistol in the other.

""Harvest time,"" Alan said.

I'm not quite certain what he was referencing.

Rust,Why Roof Ventilation Matters for Metal Roofs,"Proper [roof ventilation](https://statewideroofingspecialist.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-metal-roof-ventilation/) is crucial for the performance of metal roofs. Without it, moisture can accumulate in the attic, leading to mold growth, rust, and reduced insulation efficiency. There are two main types of roof ventilation: passive and active. Passive ventilation allows hot air to escape through vents placed on the roof, while active ventilation uses fans to increase airflow. Ensuring that your metal roof has adequate ventilation can prevent issues like ice dams, condensation, and excessive heat buildup, ultimately extending the life of your roof and improving energy efficiency.",ValuableSharing,2025-10-07T11:33:37,Reddit

Rust,What is the name of this part.,"Was swapping the battery for a 2010 Chrysler Town &amp; Country and the nut on the negative terminal was stuck/rusted on so tight that after fighting with it for a day and trying various things to get it off, I ended up tearing the metal in half on accident.  (where the screw hole is in the picture of the positive one ).  So now I need to replace the entire piece at the end of the cable going to the battery.  

I can not for the life of me find a match for this piece though.  The closest I can find are cable lugs but none of them really match what's in the picture.  I was just wondering if anyone could help stear me in the right direction.  Or does it even matter and using one of those lugs would be fine.  ",AskAMechanic,2025-10-07T11:30:59,Reddit
Rust,Unsure which direction to go in: infrastructure/systems or back-end/full-stack,"For a quick background, I graduated in 2020 with a BS in CS + math minor. Shortly after, I did 11 weeks of App Academy’s full-stack bootcamp (JavaScript/HTML/CSS, Ruby on Rails). Then I worked at TCS for 2 months that was basically training in Java, SQL, and microservices.

Then I got an offer from AWS and I worked there for about a year and 3 months on the EBS (Elastic Block Store, cloud storage for EC2 instances) encryption team. I did stuff like:

* Worldwide deployments and monitoring of encryption software updates to 100+ availability zones, including government regions.
* Worked on a Python CLI tool to speed up provisioning of encryption servers to reduce insufficient capacity problems.
* Wrote periodic metric collection code for the encryption codebase rewrite in Rust
* On-call shifts: root cause analysis, fixing errors, customer tickets, and maintaining encryption servers. So basically a mix of deployments, distributed systems code, tooling, and production maintenance.

After that, I did 4 months at a company called Pride Automation where I worked on their checklist web app (PrideView). Mostly front-end bug fixes in JavaScript/HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, and fixed a backend endpoint. Overall, this is about 2 years of experience, most of it at AWS.

I've been unemployed for nearly a year and a half at this point (largely due to uncomfortable hand symptoms, haven't sent out a large amount of applications). I’ve been doing online courses on Spring Boot, Java EE, Docker, React, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, building small full-stack projects, solving many LeetCode problems, and generally targeting full-stack or back-end roles.

My main question:  
After chatting with ChatGPT, it says my AWS experience aligns with mainly **infrastructure or systems software engineering**, and that my best chances are to get a job in that area, though my last day there was over 2.5 years ago. Is it correct and should I double down on this path, or should I keep aiming for back-end or full-stack? Both areas interest me, but I do want to have the best chance at landing a job.",cscareerquestions,2025-10-07T11:25:42,Reddit

I originally made it for myself because I was tired of switching between tabs every time I wanted to remember what a function did. Ended up getting kind of addicted to just hovering around code and passively learning things I didn’t know I needed. It’s genuinely made me a better Python dev without even trying that hard.

If it sounds useful to you, feel free to check it out or drop feedback.

Python,MD to HTML simple idea,"Like many of you, I live in Markdown for all my notes, documentation, and reports. It's fast and efficient for writing, but I always hated sharing the raw .md files with clients or non-technical stakeholders.  


It just looks unprofessional. The code blocks are flat walls of text, and the whole document feels like a messy first draft, not a polished final report.

So, I decided to build a simple tool to fix this for myself: a web-based converter that transforms plain Markdown into a clean, professional HTML page with proper syntax highlighting.



You can try it out here: [https://boldtake.io/md-to-html](https://boldtake.io/md-to-html)



What it does:  


Instantly converts your Markdown to clean HTML.

Adds VS Code-style syntax highlighting for 190+ languages.

Has a live preview that updates as you type.

Includes light/dark themes.

Lets you copy or download the final HTML with one click.

It's free, and no sign-up is needed.



I built this to solve my own problem, but I'm sure others have similar frustrations. I'd love to get some feedback from this community.

My main question for you all is: What else do you wish you could do with your Markdown files?

Are there other formats you constantly need to convert to (like clean PDFs, Word docs)? Do you need pre-made templates for certain types of reports? Any other annoying little problems you face when sharing your work?

I'm happy to build out more features based on what people actually need. Let me know what you think, or if there's anything else I can help with!

Thanks for checking it out.",SideProject,2025-10-07T12:09:25,Reddit
Python,How hard is CS 1063?,"So I’m currently working on a double major and have to take CS 1063 in the spring. For context I’ve taken a lot of math classes (Calc I,II, &amp; III, Diff. Eq. I &amp; II, Linear Algebra) and an engineering numerical method class where we used python. I thought python was extremely easy, I know it’s meant to be easy. 

Anyways, do you believe I would struggle in CS 1063? I just wanna know if I could blow off the class and focus on my other harder classes or if I actually need to pay attention. 

Also any other tips you could give me would be appreciated. ",UTSA,2025-10-07T12:06:37,Reddit

Python,High speed bridge between unreal 5.5 and python,"I was working on my 3D game in Unreal Engine 5.5, and part of it involved Reinforcement Learning (RL) AI in Python.

I looked around for existing bridges between Python and Unreal, but none of them met my requirements — not even close.
So I decided to build my own, a Simple Socket Bridge (SSB) based purely on Unreal’s native TCP sockets.

It’s designed mainly for offline AI training, with Unreal 5.5 acting as the environment and Python doing the training logic.
There’s no TLS or web protocols, just a lightweight, optimized TCP bridge.

Performance results:
• Average latency: ~1.6 ms round trip (rare spikes up to 5 ms)
• Average throughput: ~1.44 GB/s one-way (tested with continuous 4096-byte chunks for 5 seconds)
• Tested on localhost, single thread, Windows 10

The throughput number is likely limited by my PC’s hardware rather than the bridge itself — since it uses only built-in Unreal networking and Python’s standard socket library.

I haven’t tested other Unreal versions yet, but because there are no external dependencies or protocol locks, so it will most likely be fine and I expect very low or no maintenance even after engine updates.

The thing I like the most is how easy it is to set up — you literally just paste the plugin folder into your project, generate project files, build, and it works.

I want to ask your opinions about this software's worth as i have no idea where to even start but I'm sure it worth quite a lot especially when thinking about the amount of time this can reduce for training AI in real time using the realistic visual from unreal 5.5 and onwards with the AI advancement daily.

I can also include a small test Python server and Unreal example if that helps demonstrate it better as well as some cautions demonstrated there as there are some real headaches when you try to use this without understanding.

English isn’t my first language, so please be kind.
I’ll be around for about an hour to answer questions before I head to sleep as there will be things i didn't know to add into this post or just simply forgot because of how fried my brain is

Python,Any app that auto process and filter GPX tracks then upload them,"I have around couple hundred to 1K GPX traces. Initial I started cleaning up manually but that at this scale it became tremendous task. Some tracks slipped unfiltered (I was using GPS Prune).

I am looking for tools to auto-process them:

1. Clean up raw traces. (GPS Babel works good besice offers time shift) 
2. Remove portions in area for privacy (GPS Babel is moderate, but could be tweaked). Basically I don't want to remove section if record doesn't start or end there, just passing-by. 
3. Split trace based map features: missing road, administrative border, road grades. (for privacy) 
4. Auto generate name and upload tags using revere-geocode
5. Upload to OSM (I didn't look yet)

So Anyone aware of any app or scripts for 3 &amp; 4?

Python,3 years of owning my ball python and I made the biggest mistake tonight💔,"I made a mistake and now my ball python is stuck behind my cabinet. 

If you want to comment and tell me how irresponsible it was to not keep an eye on him, you can. But please know that I’m already beating myself up over it enough.

“Boo” is about to shed and was soaking in his water bowl all day today. His water bowl is on the cold side of his tank, so my boyfriend and I decided we should let him have a warm soak in the sink where it would be more comfortable temperature-wise. 

My boyfriend watched him for a good 20 minutes and then he was ready to put him back, but he seemed to be really enjoying his soak so I said I’d keep an eye on him. After another 20 minutes or so I went over the couch where I THOUGHT (stupidly) I could keep an eye on him because I can see the sink from the couch. 

I don’t want to go into detail about everything that transpired after but he wedged himself into the gap underneath the window sill and by the time we were attempting to get him out he managed to get a third of his body into a hole that appears to go behind our corner cabinet. 

We tried hard to just keep a firm hold on him and not pull - but as you can see in the third photo he appeared to get himself stuck even more by trying to bring his head back out and go so stressed that he defecated 🥺

At that point, we were worried about hurting his and let him go. 

We cut a hole in the back of the corner cabinet and left a hide and some water in there and we plan to borrow a scope tomorrow to see if we can locate him.

I feel absolutely horrible and just hope he’s okay 💔 

I felt I should share here as a PSA not to be as irresponsible as me. ",ballpython,2025-10-07T11:52:33,Reddit
Python,Just built a tool that turns any app into a windows service - open-soure alternative to AlwaysUp &amp; FireDaemon,"Hi all,

I built Servy, a Windows tool that lets you run any app as a native Windows service with full control over working directory, startup type, process priority, logging, health checks, environment variables, dependencies, pre-launch and post-launch hooks, and parameters.

If you've ever struggled with the limitations of the built-in sc tool or found nssm lacking in features or ui, Servy might be exactly what you need. It solves a common problem where services default to C:\Windows\System32 as their working directory, breaking apps that rely on relative paths or local configs.

Servy lets you run any executable as a windows service, including Node.js, Python, .NET apps, scripts, and more. It allows you to set a custom working directory to avoid path issues, redirect stdout and stderr to log files with rotation, and includes built-in health checks with automatic recovery and restart policies. The tool features a clean, modern UI for easy service management, service monitoring with cpu/ram usage tracking and logs, and is compatible with Windows 7 through Windows 11 as well as Windows Server.

It's perfect for keeping non-service apps running in the background and ensuring they start automatically at system boot without having to rewrite them as services.

Python,Is his aving almost no work at a corporate job the new normal? Help?,"I genuinely work maybe 8 to 12 hours a week. The rest of the time, I'm just... sitting. I read long-form articles on The Atlantic, watch videos about restoring old tools, and I've even started learning to cook French cuisine. My biggest stress right now is looking busy with my camera on during team meetings. Is this really corporate life in America?

About eight months ago, I was hired as a business intelligence analyst at a large fintech company right after finishing grad school. The hiring process was incredibly tough - there was a technical challenge where I had to untangle some messy sales data and build a dashboard, a case study presentation, and several rounds of behavioral interviews with some Python logic puzzles mixed in. They seemed serious about hiring for a demanding role.

Now I'm here with a respectable six-figure salary and excellent benefits in a hybrid role (3 days in the office, 2 from home), but I spend my days with an almost comical amount of free time. My first big task was to clean up the sales pipeline data and build some new performance dashboards. I finished it super fast, way ahead of schedule, and my manager was thrilled with the result.

But since finishing that project four months ago, my workload has plummeted. I get occasional requests to pull specific data or create a simple chart that takes me 45 minutes at most. I've started using some simple, modern methods that feel obvious to me.

I created a few dynamic templates on our data viz platform that I can tweak for most new requests. The head of sales called me a 'data wizard' in a team meeting because I used a waterfall chart instead of the standard bar graphs they've apparently been using since 2005. I'm not kidding.

The operations team is convinced I work extra hours because I schedule their weekly report emails to be sent at 7 AM. In reality, I have them done by 3 PM the day before and spend the rest of the day making cocktails.

My 'secret' is that I rely heavily on AI. I use an AI assistant to write most of my SQL queries. My 60-year-old manager saw some nested queries on my screen a few days ago and said, 'It's amazing how you young folks are so gifted with this database stuff.' Sir, I'm just copy-pasting. I also wrote a simple script to help the ops team merge their monthly reports (honestly, I just explained the problem to an AI and cleaned up the code). We learned this exact thing in a course, but they acted like I invented fire. Their previous solution? Manually copy-pasting in Excel like it's 1999.

In the big weekly department meetings, I use an AI meeting tool to take notes so I can zone out. When someone asked about a specific metric from last quarter's meeting, I simply queried the AI transcript while they were all still trying to remember. It feels like a superpower, but... why isn't everyone doing this?

So yeah, I'm mostly just waiting for something to do. I've started renaming all my digital photos with a uniform naming system just to feel productive. In college, they drilled the idea of 'fast-paced corporate environments' and 'crushing deadlines' into our heads. This... is not that.

Last week, my manager pulled me into a surprise meeting. I thought, 'This is it, I'm busted.' Instead, he praised my efficiency and asked if I could run a workshop for the rest of the team to 'share my advanced techniques.' I don't know what techniques I'm supposed to teach them - how to phrase an AI prompt? How to use Google effectively?

Is this a common experience? Did I just stumble upon a cheat code for corporate life? I feel like I'm living in a strange dream where the perception of my work is completely disconnected from the actual effort involved. What am I missing?",SecurityCareerAdvice,2025-10-07T11:27:37,Reddit
Python,10 Best Educative Courses for Python Developers in 2025,,javarevisited,2025-10-07T11:26:32,Reddit
Python,Unsure which direction to go in: infrastructure/systems or back-end/full-stack,"For a quick background, I graduated in 2020 with a BS in CS + math minor. Shortly after, I did 11 weeks of App Academy’s full-stack bootcamp (JavaScript/HTML/CSS, Ruby on Rails). Then I worked at TCS for 2 months that was basically training in Java, SQL, and microservices.

Then I got an offer from AWS and I worked there for about a year and 3 months on the EBS (Elastic Block Store, cloud storage for EC2 instances) encryption team. I did stuff like:

* Worldwide deployments and monitoring of encryption software updates to 100+ availability zones, including government regions.
* Worked on a Python CLI tool to speed up provisioning of encryption servers to reduce insufficient capacity problems.
* Wrote periodic metric collection code for the encryption codebase rewrite in Rust
* On-call shifts: root cause analysis, fixing errors, customer tickets, and maintaining encryption servers. So basically a mix of deployments, distributed systems code, tooling, and production maintenance.

After that, I did 4 months at a company called Pride Automation where I worked on their checklist web app (PrideView). Mostly front-end bug fixes in JavaScript/HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, and fixed a backend endpoint. Overall, this is about 2 years of experience, most of it at AWS.

I've been unemployed for nearly a year and a half at this point (largely due to uncomfortable hand symptoms, haven't sent out a large amount of applications). I’ve been doing online courses on Spring Boot, Java EE, Docker, React, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, building small full-stack projects, solving many LeetCode problems, and generally targeting full-stack or back-end roles.

My main question:  
After chatting with ChatGPT, it says my AWS experience aligns with mainly **infrastructure or systems software engineering**, and that my best chances are to get a job in that area, though my last day there was over 2.5 years ago. Is it correct and should I double down on this path, or should I keep aiming for back-end or full-stack? Both areas interest me, but I do want to have the best chance at landing a job.",cscareerquestions,2025-10-07T11:25:42,Reddit
